I would like to bring to your attention the scorekeeper of the Memphis Grizzlies.  I was wondering how a solid defensive player can suddenly have some specific statistical categories that are completely off the charts.  I am referring to Jaren Jackson Jr., who, after having missed ~16 games to start the season due to off-season foot surgery immediately started having extreme outlier high steals + blocks statistics, leading the entire NBA in blocks per game by a wide margin.  In fewer minutes per game than other players Jaron Jackson repeatedly gets outlandish block numbers at home. 

I decided to take a closer look at his games and IMMEDIATELY 1 thing became crystal clear.  At home in Memphis he has 66 blocks in 16 home games, averaging 4.13 blocks per game, versus just 35 in 16 road games, averaging 2.19 in nearly identical minutes- an 89% increase in Memphis.  In home games he has been credited with 22 steals in 16 home games, versus only 10 steals in 16 road games.  This means he is averaging nearly 1.4 steals per game at home, but just 0.63 steals on the road per game- an astounding 120% increase in Memphis.  In home games he has been credited with 88 blocks + steals, versus 45 on the road.  This equates to an average of an outlandish 5.5 blocks+steals at home in limited minutes versus a reasonable and realistic, and still outstanding, 2.81 steals+blocks per game on the road.  This equates to a 1.96X home stat increase only in these 2 categories.  A 96% increase in performance specifically at home is truly an aberration which should be reviewed.  This demonstrates the sort of incredulous statistics which calls for serious analysis. 

Just 3 out of his 14 games this season with 5+ blocks+steals have come on the road.  8 out of 9 of his 6+ steals+blocks games have been recorded in Memphis.  I decided to watch 2 memphis grizzlies games where he had one of his ludicrous 8+ blocks+steals games.  By my count he actually had 3 fewer ""stocks""(some people refer to steals+blocks as stocks) than he was credited for by the home scorekeeper.  I wonder if the scorekeeper has some sort of vested interest in Jaren Jackson getting maximum high value defensive statistics that he thinks he can get away with putting down into the box score.  

Jaren Jackson in July - mid November started as high as +10,000 for DPOY at certain sportsbooks after the Grizzlies announced he had undergone a procedure to address a stress fracture in his right foot and would be sidelined for 4-6 months.  Now, in large part thanks to these blatantly wrong statistics, he is a huge odds on favorite at higher than -200. 

I conducted some analysis on all 78 games jaren jackson played last season... my hypothesis was that his home/road difference on steals & blocks would both be small.  He had 90 blocks in Memphis and 87 blocks on the road.  He had 39 steals in Memphis and 34 steals on the road.  He had 129 ""stocks"" in Memphis vs. 121 ""stocks"" on the road.  BPG was actually 12.7% lower on the road(he played 4 fewer home games) while steals+blocks/game was 15% lower on the road- higher than i expected, but reasonable given all the differences for Memphis when playing at home vs on the road, from their home/away record difference to crowd noise to effort/energy/intensity exerted by players, etc.
90%+ higher in Memphis, however, as is the case this season, is NOT REASONABLE AND COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC.  My educated guess is that the Memphis scorekeeper(s) have been changed since last season and/or ULTERIOR MOTIVES, INCENTIVES are now in play with respect to JJJ's defensive statistics. 

Why is this happening so blatantly to the point where a person can just look at Jaren Jackson Jrs. steals+blocks #s on the box score and determine with a high level of confidence whether that game was played on the road or in Memphis is the next question... 

Three potential explanations, only one of which is innocent: 

1. Jaren Jackson plays MUCH MUCH MUCH harder at home and hustles like a maniac and focuses on stealing and blocking shots like crazy in Memphis, causing his numbers to be skewed in an absurd manner even compared to his regular highly efficient top 3- but realistic, road numbers. This can almost certainly be discounted because i looked at his other statistics and everything from his minutes per game to points per game to rebounds per game and even fouls are close in terms of home/away splits. 

2. The Memphis scorekeeper is a huge Jaren Jackson Jr. fan and is purposely imbellishing his steals & blocks, since that is much easier to do than points or rebounds, for instance.  When he contests a shot well, but does not touch the ball, perhaps the scorekeeper purposely gives him the undeserved stat and donates blocks to him where none occurred, for instance. 

3. It should also be investigated in this age of fantasy basketball and gambling on sports whether this scorekeeper and/or his family and friends bet on Jaren Jackson to win the defensive player of the year award at super long odds and as a result has a tremendous financial incentive to juice and fake a player's 2 most valuable defensive statistics- BLOCKS and STEALS, which are also the easiest to fudge #s on because it is often most difficult to definitively label steals and blocks without slow motion on at least some of the plays in question. 

I and all NBA fans would appreciate a thorough investigation into this matter.  It is important to have 100% integrity in statistics not only for things such as fantasy sports, sportsbetting, futures wagers, but even more importantly to ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE GAME FOR ALL.  This is mandatory to be able to compare players' statistics versus other players now in the league fairly as well as across seasons and know the numbers are accurate, correct, and not unfairly manipulated by home arena scorekeepers. 

I decided to watch just a few of the Grizzlies' recent games and immediately started noticing a pattern: Plays at FedEx arena in Memphis constantly being scored wrongly to gift Jackson extra steals and blocks which never occurred.  Simply put, if a shot does not hit the rim or it otherwise looks bad somehow, and Jaren Jackson is either contesting the shot or close to the action, he is credited with FRAUDULENT blocks repeatedly.  Sometimes this is achieved by taking away the stat from his teammates. Other times, an opposing player simply loses the ball or shoots a contested shot way off target, but Jackson nevertheless is credited with steals & blocks that never occurred in both instances.  Also, when he deflects a ball and it goes to a teammate he is credited with the steal.  When his teammate deflects the ball and it goes to him he is STILL credited with the steal IN MEMPHIS.  When he tips or deflects a ball, but never gains possession nor do the Grizzlies, he is still awarded a steal. 

The following is just a very small % of questionable or outright WRONG steals and blocks given to Jackson: 

Example #1 New Orleans Pelicans @ Memphis Grizzlies 
Saturday 12/31
7mins, 21 sec remaining in the 2nd quarter
Zion drives to the basket, NEVER shoots the ball, and loses it. ""Williamson in a crowd, ball pops free, picked up by Tyus Jones, turnover number 9 by the pelicans"" announcers say.  Scorekeeper in Memphis graded the play as Jaren Jackson Jr. blocks Zion Williamson's 3-foot driving layup 

Example #2 Utah Jazz @ Memphis Grizzlies 
Sunday 1/8 
10:09 remaining in the 1st quarter
Jordan Clarkson throws a bad pass directly to Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson for some odd reason is credited with the steal.  Bane actually steals the ball. 

Example #3 Utah Jazz @ Memphis Grizzlies
Sunday 1/8
1:46 remaining in the 4th quarter
Kelly Olynyk loses the ball while being defended by Xavier Tillman.  The ball then bounces off Tillman and Jaren Jackson before being picked up by Tillman. The steal should be credited to Tillman.  Memphis scorekeeper grades the play as Jaren Jackson Jr. steals 

Example #4 Phoenix Suns @ Memphis Grizzlies
Monday 1/16
7:02 remaining in the 4th quarter
Brandon Clarke blocks Saban Lee's layup, but the Memphis scorekeeper instantly gives the block to nearby Jaren Jackson Jr. 

Example #5 Cleveland Cavaliers @ Memphis Grizzlies
Wednesday 1/18
11:48 remaining in the 2nd quarter
Lamar Stevens, who Jaren Jackson helps on, loses the ball and Desmond Bane picks it up and gains possession.  The Memphis scorekeeper gave steal to Jaren Jackson. 

Example #6 Detroit Pistons @ Memphis Grizzlies
Friday, December 9th
39 seconds remaining in the 2nd quarter
Jackson deflects a pass and never gains possession, saved back to Detroit player. Memphis scorekeeper gives a steal to Jackson. 

Example #7 Oklahoma City Thunder @ Memphis Grizzlies
Wednesday, December 7th
10:38 4th quarter
Jackson saves out of bounds ball directly to Thunder player underneath basket for quick score, but gets credited with a steal. 

Thank you very much for reading this.  I would appreciate well thought out responses, a good discussion, and also advice on how someone in charge at the NBA can investigate these plays as well as others from Grizzlies games, and the dishonest Memphis scorekeeper.  Also, can obviously fraudulent statistics be deleted, corrected & reversed weeks/months later?"

It would be so easy for him to get upset at people bringing this up and say “it was so long ago, a different time, I apologized, did this, that, the other” but he legit still seems hurt by his past words. I just love to see his growth from this', 'Glad to see he’s changed, but also glad we got this video from it:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4s1iQODC5OI', '> Fifteen years later, Tim Hardaway’s words still reverberate in the world around him. They shadow him, torment him, stubbornly refuse to disappear.\n\n> *I hate gay people … I don’t like to be around them … I am homophobic.*\n\n> Until now, Hardaway seldom explained why he felt that way 15 years ago and how the fallout hasn’t faded. This month, in an extended phone interview with The Chronicle, Hardaway elaborated on the roots of his previous views and how those long-ago remarks affect his life today.\n\n> “I grew up in a church, and that’s the way churches were — they instilled in you that (homosexuality) wasn’t the way you should be,” he said. “I was just taught differently. Don’t talk to them, don’t mess with them, leave them alone.\n\n> “I never tried to talk bad about them or do hateful stuff. It was just my upbringing in church. But I’ll tell you this: It was so wrong of me, and people have suffered. I had to grow up and really do some soul-searching. What I said was just hurtful.”\n\n> Hardaway backtracked slightly later in the interview, saying he doesn’t blame the church and “it’s on me, too.” But he was more forceful about the impact his comments have had on his post-NBA playing career.\n\n> “A lot of people don’t want to deal with me because I said that, and I’m not getting a second chance,” Hardaway told The Chronicle. “I understand…but it does bother me. A lot of people are still holding it over me. Some organizations don’t want to talk to me. I keep moving and walk past them just like they walk past me. I’m a realist. My parents always said turn a wrong into a right, so you do what you can to show people you’re not that type of person.”\n\n> Beyond his interactions with potential employers, Hardaway sometimes cannot escape his past when he walks out in public. He feels the stares and hears the whispers, and he’s convinced they’re not simply because he was a five-time NBA All-Star.\n\n> “I know when people are looking at me crazy,” Hardaway said, “they’re thinking, ‘That’s the guy who said that about gay people.’ ”\n\n> He was nearly four years removed from his final NBA game when he went on then-Miami Herald columnist Dan Le Batard’s radio show on Feb. 14, 2007. Hardaway spent five-plus seasons playing for the Heat (1996-2001) after starting his career with the Warriors. John Amaechi, a retired NBA center, had just published a memoir in which he revealed he was gay. So Le Batard asked Hardaway how he would “deal with a gay teammate,” and he said he wouldn’t want such a player on his team.\n\n> “Well, you know, I hate gay people, so I let it be known,” Hardaway told Le Batard. “I don’t like gay people and I don’t like to be around gay people.

> There is some irony in this news item coming right after the previous one about the miseducation of American youth. Because Kyrie Irving’s thought process is an example of what happens when the education system fails.

> Last October, I wrote a piece about Kyrie Irving’s refusal to get vaccinated against COVID-19 (“Should We Just ‘Leave Kyrie Alone?”) and why this reckless choice was destructive to the country and especially the Black community where he would be an influential role model. The facts proved that accusation to be true. Irving didn’t care. He continued to promote his anti-vax sentiments—regardless of the cost in lives and health to others—proclaiming himself a “martyr.” Not kidding.

> We might have just left him alone to stew in his own gelatinous ignorance. Rich and famous people get away with saying dumb things all the time because their money isolates them from consequences. They surround themselves with Yes-people whose job is to confirm whatever hare-brained ideas they have. Yes, sir, Mr. Irving, the Earth has never been flatter.

> But now Irving is back and more destructive, insensitive, and just plain silly than before. He decided it would be a good idea to post a 2002 video clip from Infowars founder Alex Jones. Yeah, the guy who has been on trial for denying the Sandy Hook shootings and who previously admitted in open court that he’s a performer and his onscreen persona is just a character (that bilks millions of dollars from unaware viewers). The main gist of the clip is a warning about a cabal of international leaders who are secretly releasing plagues on the world from which they can profit. (Of course, we know who really profits from making this claim.)

> Alex Jones is one of the most despicable human beings alive and to associate with him means you share his stench.

> Kyrie Irving would be dismissed as a comical buffoon if it weren’t for his influence over young people who look up to athletes. When I look at some of the athletes who have used their status to actually improve society—Colin Kaepernick, LeBron James, Muhammad Ali, Bill Russel, Billie Jean King, Arthur Ashe, and more—it becomes clear how much Irving has tarnished the reputations of all athletes who strive to be seen as more than dumb jocks.

> Irving does not seem to have the capacity to change, but we have the capacity to keep fighting against his brand of destructive behavior. One way to do that, beyond shaking our heads and nasty tweets, is to write to his sponsors and tell them to drop Irving—or you will drop them. Nike has likely decided not to renew his contract past this season. But he is still sponsored by Pepsi and 2K Sports. (Don’t feel bad for Irving: his career earnings at the end of the 2022-’23 season will be $230 million. That buys a lot of Yes-people.)

> Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal is set to eclipse that mark each year for the next five years after signing a $251 million contract to stay in D.C.
> 
> When asked what his reaction was to Beal’s new deal, Barkley responded with one word.
> 
> “Wow,” Barkley said on a recent episode of the Washington Football Talk Podcast. “Let me tell you something. My mom—I love my mom, she passed away a few years ago. Every time I see one of those contracts, I want to drive to the graveyard and just snatch her up and say, ‘Why couldn’t you just wait a couple more years to have me?! Just a couple more years!”
> 
> Since his playing days, Barkley has become one of the NBA media’s most popular analysts on TNT’s Inside the NBA alongside Shaquille O’Neal, Kenny Smith and Ernie Johnson. He harbors no resentment towards players in today’s game who get their money while they can.
> 
> “You know what? Bless these young guys,” he said. “Bradley Beal’s a hell of a player. I don’t ever want to be the old ‘Get off my lawn’ guy. I made more money than Bill Russell, he’s a much better player than me. I made more money than Kareem [Abdul-Jabbar], he’s a much, much better player than me. Hey, God bless them.

>The NBA Players Association also released a statement on Nov. 1: “Anti-Semitism has no place in our society. The NBPA is focused on creating an environment where everyone is accepted. We are committed to helping players fully understand that certain words can lead to hateful ideologies being spread We will continue to work on identifying and combatting all hate speech wherever it arises.”

>Yet, Irving has been defiant about his postings. You can read his long, rambling, at times contradictory defense here. Mostly he reveals his lack of awareness of how history works. It’s not an all-you-can-eat buffet from which you can pluck just the dishes you like without any understanding of the context.

>His inability to understand why his posts are news can be seen in this statement: “There’s things being posted every day. I’m no different from the next human being, so don’t treat me any different. You guys come in here and make up this powerful influence that I have (and say) you cannot post that. Why not? Why not?” If he really thinks someone with millions of followers spouting hate speech is the same as Jim in accounting posting on Facebook, then he really is out of step with reality.

>The Nets finally forced Irving to acknowledge the damage he’s done and donate $500,000 to groups opposing hate speech. In his statement you can almost hear his arm being twisted: “I oppose all forms of hatred and oppression and stand strong with communities that are marginalized and impacted every day. I am aware of the negative impact of my post towards the Jewish community and I take responsibility."" But there was no explicit apology—which tells us everything about what he really believes.

>Honestly, there’s little hope that he will change because he’s insulated by fame and money and surrounded by yes-people. There is no motivation to learn how to distinguish propaganda from facts. All that’s left is for the world to decide how it should respond to him.

>Kareem Note: The problem of antisemitism is much bigger than Irving or Ye. They are merely the unwitting spokesperson for the right-wing political movement that is blatantly taking over the GOP. (For the full story, read “Jewish leaders call on GOP candidates to reject antisemitic comments”). Many Republican candidates running for some of the most powerful positions in their states and in the country—such as Pennsylvania’s GOP gubernatorial nominee Doug Mastriano—feel perfectly free to publicly spout antisemitic statements without fear of reprisal from their own party or the voters. That should be a very troubling sign for all marginalized groups because fascists always start by demonizing one group—right before they go after the others.

When you get guys as talented as KD and Kyrie (and there are few as talented as those two in the league) who are in great situations (Kyrie in Cleveland and then Boston; KD in Golden State) and then walk away to pursue personal glory, it's always kind of sad to miss out on what could have happened.

The actual alleged version of events is in the story: the boy told detectives Morant had a gun visible in his waistband and placed his hand on the weapon.', ""Bro thinks he's Marlo Stanfield"", ""Mall incident mentioned in the article is new:\n\n> A call from the mall\nMorant is known for highflying dunks, a thirst for trash talk and a tightknit relationship with his father, Tee, who sits courtside at many games. His family has become so much a part of Morant’s brand that Tee Morant narrated the commercial launching his son’s latest major brand deal, with Powerade.\n\n>Ja Morant was one of the stars of last year’s playoffs before the Grizzlies lost a heated series with the eventual-champion Golden State Warriors.  Two months after the loss to Golden State, Morant’s mother was at a Finish Line shoe store at a Memphis mall when she got in a dispute with a store employee, according to a Memphis Police report obtained by The Post. She called Morant, who arrived shortly after with a group of as many as nine other people.\n\n>Confronted by the director of mall security, Morant and his friends refused the security guard’s demands to leave the mall parking lot. Police arrived and a “verbal confrontation” escalated, the report says, until someone in the group allegedly pushed the security director in the head.\n\n>“As the group was leaving the premises … Ja Morant said, ‘Let me find out what time he gets off,’ ” police wrote in the report.\n\n>The guard wanted to file a report, police wrote, “because he felt threatened by the statement from Ja Morant” and had been assaulted by the person who had pushed him. The “disturbing parties left the scene,” and no arrests were made.\n\n> The Grizzlies, NBA and Morant’s agent did not respond to questions about the incident. The security guard declined to comment.\n\n-\n\nAlso his best friend Pack seems to be a common denominator (and the punched boy's mom doesn't seem to have a good rep in the legal system):\n\n> In an interview with police, a transcript shows, one of Morant’s attorneys, who did not respond to a request for comment from The Post, said the boy’s mother had demanded millions of dollars from Morant after the incident. “The first thing we got was a 20 million dollar demand. This is a shake down,” he said. The boy’s mother has a history of filing lawsuits that have eventually been dismissed, court records show, including a discrimination lawsuit against the city’s fire department and a lawsuit against her children’s school district after she said they were bullied on a school bus.\n\n\n\n> The police report does not name Morant’s “best friend,” who the boy said had punched him on the other side of the jaw. But a person familiar with the lawsuit, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because it was under seal, said the friend was Pack, a childhood friend of Morant’s who is also named in the family’s lawsuit. Pack could not be reached for comment.\n\n> Pack shouted expletives at Pacers players, the Athletic reported, until an official intervened and Pack was escorted off the floor. Later that night, the Athletic reported, the altercation continued outside the arena, where members of Morant’s entourage confronted members of the Pacers near the team’s bus. After Morant got into an SUV, a red laser was trained at members of the team from inside the car, the Athletic reported, prompting a member of the Pacers’ security team to say, “That’s 100 percent a gun.”"", ""Ja or someone from his group is gonna test the wrong person one day and it won't end well."", 'The spirit of Gilbert Arenas lives on.', 'Why does he want to live that life so badly', 'Even if he’s been cleared by everyone, you gotta be smarter than to be put in these situations.', 'That 17 year old boy?

The other posts on this are paywall'd so here's the most important excerpt 

>Four days later, Morant repeatedly punched a teenage boy in the head during a pickup basketball game at Morant’s house, the boy told police. Morant and his friend struck the 17-year-old so hard they knocked him to the ground and left him with a “large knot” on the side of his head, according to a police report narrative written by deputies who said they observed the boy’s injuries.

> The teenager told detectives from the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office that, after the fight, Morant went into his house and re-emerged with a gun visible in the waistband of his pants and his hand on the weapon, according to police interviews obtained by The Post, which have not previously been reported.

> In an interview with police, Morant said he acted in self-defense. “I swung first,” he told detectives, but he believed the boy had been the aggressor because he threw a ball at Morant’s head and then stepped toward him, pulling up his pants. “The ball was to me the first hit,” Morant told police.
During the interview, detectives mentioned the boy’s allegation that Morant flashed a gun but did not ask Morant whether it was true.

> Morant told police that as the boy left, he shouted, “I’m gonna come back and light this place up like fireworks.” Weeks after the incident, according to records obtained by The Post, Morant filed a police report about the boy’s comment, saying the teenager had threatened his family.


> In a statement, Morant’s agent, Jim Tanner, characterized the allegations as “unsubstantiated rumors and gossip are being put out by people motivated to tear Ja down and tarnish his reputation for their own financial gain.” The boy and his mother filed a lawsuit against Morant over the incident, his family attorney confirmed. The existence of the suit, which is under seal, was reported earlier this year by TMZ.

> “Any and every allegation involving a firearm has been fully investigated and could not be corroborated. This includes the NBA investigation last month, in which they found no evidence,” Tanner said. The incident with the teenage boy, Tanner said, “was purely self-defense. Again, after this was fully investigated by law enforcement, they came to the decision not to charge Ja with any crime.”"

They get it right sometimes, unfortunately']","Now let me preface this by saying I brought this up a couple of years ago and some mods got really mad and threatened to ban me. So I'm just saying, mods, this is not a criticism of y'all, and it's different than my original suggestions (more limited in scope). It's also been 2 years so cut me some slack.

------------


Let's look at two top highlights from the last week:

1. [Lauri shooting what seemed like a potential game-winner](https://streamable.com/6205s6) - last night ([thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/102txkn/highlight_markkanen_almost_drains_a_postential/)) [Edit: for people asking what's the issue here - no replay, but even worse, it's a highlight of a play that was ruled a shooting clock violation... without the actual shooting clock violation ruling or even a replay clearly showing it!]

2. [ Luka's legendary shot](https://streamable.com/2hbe1d) to tie the game with the Knicks ([thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/zwzklx/highlight_luka_doncic_intentionally_misses_the_ft/) - 40k points, top of r/all).


The replays/alternative angle comment **does not work in practice**. It might be a nice idea in theory, but in reality, it doesn't work. People don't post there, or post very late to it, when it doesn't matter anymore. The vast, vast majority of people just get to languish with shit replays.

Compare it with this:

* Kyrie's [putback dunk](https://streamable.com/i7fkw4) ([thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/101tvd8/highlight_kyrie_irving_with_the_putbackdunk/))

While the first two were game-clinching shots, they got no context, no crowd reaction, no replay. Meanwhile Kyrie's shot has joyous Yuta in it, replay, the whole deal.

The reason this happens is a race-to-the-bottom among uploaders. Since the first one - and always the first one - gets to keep their version, r/nba incentivizes uploaders to give us the shortest, most crappy version possible. Any extra 10 seconds left for recording means someone beats you to it.

A lot of the prolific uploaders (it's a small group) said again and again they have no problem uploading quality highlights with replays - but it's not worth it. 

**My suggestion** is simple - any game-winning or game tying shot, or for that matter any highlight in the last 1 minute of the game, must be at least 30 seconds long. 

I'm not even telling the mods to enforce a ""must have replay"" rule (which is the superior option imo). Just have a strong, technical limit on these posts, that can be completely automated to enforce - literally ZERO WORK for the mods except coding it in. You can have a new tag [Endgame Highlight] for those, and **any post with the [Endgame Highlight] tag must be 30 seconds or longer**, just like all highlights are already auto-forced to be 720p and higher. 

I think this very minimal, hyper-specific, easy to implement, zero maintenance suggestion is pretty reasonable - so I petition the mods to consider it, to improve all of ours highlight quality.

edit: I can't believe the first link was (by mistake), a link to a wholesome comic pic [from this page](https://www.instagram.com/mrs.frollein/) and NOT a highlight, and still I got someone who said ""That highlight is perfectly fine!"" lmaooo"

The beginning period for the franchise is the most successful in its history, as the team won the NBL title in their first season as a member of the league. They went to the NBL Finals two more times before the league merged with the BAA to become the NBA for the 1949-50 season. The Royals continued having success, winning their second title in 1951, defeating the rival New York Knicks 4-3. The Royals began the 1951-52 season strong, sprinting out to a 28-16 record (.636) and looking like worthy title holders with a chance to repeat. Life was good.

And then, King George VI died. Queen Elizabeth took the throne of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on February 6, 1952.

The franchise was never the same. The Royals slowed a bit down the stretch in 1952, going 13-9 (.590) and falling to the eventual champ Minneapolis Lakers in 4 games in the conference finals. After having made the NBL/NBA Finals 4 out of 6 years while King George reigned, the Royals would never make it back under the eye of Queen Elizabeth. The Royals, recognizing this, began to move westward to try to escape the queen’s influence. They played 5 more seasons in Rochester, making it back to the conference finals once, but never the NBA Finals. The team moved further inland, to Cincinnati, where they spent 15 years never tasting the Finals again. 13 further years in Kansas City and Omaha produced no further luck, even as the team renamed themselves the Kings to recall their glory days under King George and to spurn Queen Elizabeth. Finally, the team bit the bullet and moved almost as far west as they could, to Sacramento, but even that could not pry them from her clutches. For 70 seasons, her power had kept the team in the lower reaches of the NBA.

Monarch |Wins|Losses|Winning Pct
:--|:--|:--|:--
King George VI|264|114|.698
Queen Elizabeth II|2489|3112|.444

The team had made 6 conference finals in 6 seasons under King George, and 6 conference finals in *70* seasons under Queen Elizabeth. Their only titles and only Finals appearances remained under him.

And then, this morning, she finally passed away. King Charles III rose to the throne.

What does this mean for the Kings? Clearly, now that there is once again a King ruling over Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Kings have been freed from Queen Elizabeth and will rise to reclaim their spot at the top of the NBA. The team will be restored to its former glory as British citizens sing “God Save the Kings” and Kinggan Murray wins MVP, Finals MVP, Rookie of the Year, and the scoring title in the same season. The only advice I can offer: prepare yourselves."

> **You think you would have been in Sacramento longer if they didn’t let him go?**

> Absolutely. We would’ve been winning. We would’ve won. Probably would have finished my career there along with Mike. Simple as that. I don’t reflect on it much anymore. I’ve kind of bounced around and been through so much other things, it’s hard to even harp on that situation. Sitting there focusing on that, I probably wouldn’t be where I’m at now. I had to put a lot of time and focus on just righting my wrongs, correcting my body, trying to get back in shape and all the other rehab. It was just so much other things.

He passed away a few days ago', '[deleted]', 'Can the season start please 🙏', 'Most normal /r/nba member', 'I can’t do this rn \n\nI cannot do this rn']","So I know most people look at this title and go ""wtf are you talking about?"", but I have the receipts.

First, I do want to clarify that this post isn't saying that I think Wiseman is/isn't a bust or that I thought he would/wouldn't bust, merely that over a decade ago, the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game (TCG) predicted that he would be drafted by the Golden State Warriors and bust.

With that out of the way, let's go over some facts about James Wiseman.

1 - He is the only NBA player (per Basketball Reference) to have the last name ""Wiseman"".

2 - He is a very large human being, listed at 7 feet tall and 240 pounds.  There are a few larger players, but over 7 feet they become much less common.

3 - He has very highly rated physical tools. This [draft report](https://www.peachtreehoops.com/2020/11/13/21545699/james-wiseman-2020-nba-draft-scouting-report-atlanta-hawks-memphis-center-offense-defense-analysis) praised his size, length, and athleticism.

4 - His offensive skills were raised as a question mark in that same draft report.

5 - Parts of his defensive game were question marks as well, mainly switching on the perimter and getting in foul trouble.

6 - He had an extremely underwhelming rookie season where he often looked lost on both offense and defense.

7 - He suffered a major knee injury in the middle of said rookie season and has missed a lot of time.

8 - His skin color is black.

Now that we have established these facts about James Wiseman, we can finally show how Yu-Gi-Oh! predicted that he would bust.

Allow me to introduce [Neos Wiseman](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Neos_Wiseman), a monster introduced to the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG in 2008.

Neos Wiseman is a Level 10 LIGHT Spellcaster Monster with 3000 attack and 3000 defense.  It has the following effect/card text:

""Cannot be Normal Summoned or Set. Must be Special Summoned (from your hand) by sending 1 face-up ""Elemental HERO Neos"" and 1 face-up ""Yubel"" you control to the Graveyard, and cannot be Special Summoned by other ways. This card cannot be destroyed by card effects. At the end of the Damage Step, if this card battled an opponent's monster: Inflict damage to your opponent equal to the ATK of the monster it battled, and you gain Life Points equal to that monster's DEF.""

Now given these stats and effect, let's list some facts about Neos Wiseman and compare it to the only Wiseman to ever play in the NBA.

1 - It is a very high-leveled monster.  There are higher level monsters (up to 12), but they are extremely uncommon.  This mirrors James Wiseman's size relative to the NBA and the general human population.

2 - It has excellent base stats at 3000 ATK/DEF, just like James Wiseman's physical tools.

3 - It is a LIGHT monster, just like GOLDEN State.  And if you go ""well Gold may not equal LIGHT"", [Eldlich The Golden Lord](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Eldlich_the_Golden_Lord) is a LIGHT monster so this connection is valid.

4 - While Neos Wiseman is a spellcaster, the monster that it's based on, [Elemental HERO Neos](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Elemental_HERO_Neos), is a Warrior monster.  Like the Golden State WARRIORS.  (post-bust dump to the Orlando Magic incoming?)

5 - It has a terrible summoning condition.  Elemental HERO Neos is a Level 7 Normal Monster (1 tribute to summon) and Yubel is a Level 10 with no special summoning condition (2 tributes to summon), so getting both on the field while also having Neos Wiseman in hand is never going to happen.  This means that Neos Wiseman is almost never going to be successfully summoned.  Similarly, due to poor play and injury, James Wiseman has had minimal playing time.

6 - Its offensive effect is a nearly-worthless extra burn damage when destroying an opponent's monster.  For how hard it is to summon, it should be able to actively remove opponent's cards while still attacking other monsters, like what [Baronne de Fleur](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Baronne_de_Fleur) does.  This is similar to James Wiseman lacking offensive skills entering the NBA.

7 - Its protection isn't enough, and it has no way to interrupt your opponent.  There are plenty of cards like [Compulsory Evacuation Device](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Compulsory_Evacuation_Device) and [Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Divine_Arsenal_AA-ZEUS_-_Sky_Thunder) that can remove Neos Wiseman without destroying it.  This is similar to James Wiseman's poor defensive positioning in the NBA and tendency to pick up fouls and take himself out of the game.

8 - Neos Wiseman's main color is black, with some purple accents and what appears to be a white leotard-type piece of clothing and blue chest jewel.  James Wiseman is also black, wears a white jersey when the Warriors are at home and blue when they are away, and his knee probably swelled up and turned purple when he injured it.  

And there you have it!  When James Wiseman was still in first grade, Yu-Gi-Oh! predicted his NBA future with frightening accuracy.  Will he return strong from injury and become a great player, or will he go down as one of the biggest busts of all time?  Find out on next week's episode of Dragonball Z!"

vtil6w,[Windhorst] The Nets thought there would be a bidding war for Kevin Durant. They were wrong.,"[""I don't think a lot of teams in championship contention want to lose half their roster for one player even if it's Kevin Durant."", ""It is hard to have a bidding war when the requirements to get him would turn your team into a non-contender that KD wouldn't even want to play with"", 'Fuck it, we will take him.

This could easily worsen since he will be 34 when the season starts.\n2. There is no guarantee he won't force an out again.\n3. The cost of acquiring him completely depletes the team of all quality players. The Nets have shown that a team with Durant and an all-star will still get swept in the playoffs.\n4. The team needs to be prepared the same way Toronto was when they got Leonard, which is to field a team that can be in the playoffs even without Durant. No team can trade for Durant and still field a team that can do that.\n\nUltimately, Durant's massive contract actually works against him and the Nets. He would be significantly easier to move if he only had 1-2 years left on his contract, since it's less risk for the team trading for him, and also less assets given up to acquire him."", 'I bring it on myself by F5-ing so much, but this past 1-2 weeks has made me realize how silly and eyeroll inducing NBA media is lol', 'I’ve got an idea. Why don’t Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and Ben Simmons all join the same team. Surround them with some solid role players like O’Neale, Curry, Warren, Harris. That could be a decent team. Just spitballing though.', ""Probably doesn't help Brooklyn that KD gave 1 real destination in Phoenix (reportedly said Miami too but then reports came out that he didnt want Bam or Jimmy traded lmfao), so makes sense why so many teams would be hesistant on mortgaging 6 years worth of draft picks and young guys for 34 yr old KD""]","According to Brian Windhorst:

-	When the Nets put Kevin Durant on the markets, the Nets thought there would be a tremendous bidding war. While there’s a lot of interest, the bidding war is not hot. Teams have made their offers and don’t feel the need to increase them. 

-	After the Gobert trade, Brooklyn raised their price, but GMs have told them they thought it was a major overpay, and they are not willing to offer even a comparable haul for Kevon Durant.

-	All the executives are gathered in Las Vegas for summer league, so there could be a restart of discussions for Keven there.

-	There was belief that after the Golbert trade, that Mitchell would go next. The Jazz aren’t planning to do anything and Mitchell is not going to force action now. Until he does, the Jazz are off the table in the KB sweepstakes.

-	Teams are not trying to outbid each other for Kevan Durant. It makes no sense to sell your house than buy a car, even if that car is a Lamborghini like Kevyn.

Do you think any team is making a mistake by not aggressively going after Kelvin Durant? Which team has the best package for Kyle Durant? What does this mean for #34’s legacy?

After his rookie season, which saw the former Villanova product earn All-Rookie honors, Bey spent a large part of his offseason playing with Team USA. From there, he participated in Detroit’s Summer League stint in Las Vegas. After that, Bey went on to play and start in all 82 games for the Pistons. In his free time, Bey brought his work home, or vice versa. He’d always end up at the team’s practice facility.

>	Bey’s new pastime, though, is part of a bigger plan. He didn’t seek out hiking. That just comes with the environment he temporarily calls home. Bey also didn’t spin a globe, close his eyes and move to whichever state his finger landed on. It was all strategic and picked with basketball in mind. In that world, Colorado is known for its altitude. At higher elevations, breathing isn’t easy. Fatigues sets in quicker. If someone is in shape in Colorado, they’re in shape everywhere.

Nov 16 (Reuters) - U.S. crypto investors sued FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and several celebrities who promoted his exchange including NFL quarterback Tom Brady and comedian Larry David, claiming they engaged in deceptive practices to sell FTX yield-bearing digital currency accounts.

The proposed class action filed on Tuesday night in Miami alleges that FTX yield-bearing accounts were unregistered securities that were unlawfully sold in the United States.

FTX filed for bankruptcy and is facing scrutiny from U.S. authorities amid reports that $10 billion in customer assets were shifted from FTX to Bankman-Fried's trading company Alameda Research.

When the crypto exchange faltered on liquidity concerns, U.S. investors sustained $11 billion in damages, the lawsuit says.

The lawsuit seeks damages from Bankman-Fried and 11 athletes and other celebrities who promoted FTX, including David, the creator of ""Seinfeld"" and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm.""

David starred in a commercial for FTX that aired during the 2022 Super Bowl in which he portrayed fictional characters dismissing important innovations throughout history and ended with the message ""Don't Miss Out on Crypto.""

Brady, tennis star Naomi Osaka and professional basketball team the Golden State Warriors are also defendants in the lawsuit.

Representatives for Bankman-Fried, Brady, Osaka, David and the Golden State Warriors did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.

John J. Ray III, FTX's new chief executive who is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit, declined to comment on the allegations.

The lawsuit was brought on behalf of Edwin Garrison, an Oklahoma resident who had an FTX yield-bearing account which he funded with crypto assets to earn interest, and others like him."

LeBron made a 3-1 comeback in the Finals against a 73-9 team with Kyrie. KD couldn’t even last two proper seasons with him before requesting a trade. As soon as things get tough, KD goes around building teams that can't lose. 

LeBron joins his friends to beat his enemies. Durant joins his enemies to beat his friends. Major difference. One still shows respect to the spirit of competition, the other completely disregards competition & what sports are supposed to be about.

TLDR: Durant has done more damage to his sport than any other athlete ever has and people let him get away with it because they have such an irrational hatred for LeBron. It's sick."

&gt; “I would like it, of course, but it’s not something that I’m deciding,” said Jokic, who is likely to win his second consecutive MVP award sometime soon. “I think of course if it’s offered — if (the) offer is on the table — of course I’m going to accept it because I really like the organization and really like the people who work here.”

&gt; Slow down for a brief moment and ponder that sentiment again. In today’s NBA, when so many stars spend so much time sending messages of discontent that often spark chaos, here was Jokic making it abundantly clear that these past four years of disappointing playoff finishes weren’t enough to sour him on the potential that remains here. If you’re a small-market team pondering the sanity of making this kind of financial investment, it’s the kind of emotional buy-in that should make you feel that much better about the choice.

&gt; “I’m in (a) really good relationship with people who work here, and a good relationship with everybody from the owner to, let’s say, the equipment manager,” he continued. “I think we have something that we’re building. It actually feels really good.”

Khelcey Barrs III was a 15 year old basketball phenom from Leuzinger High School in Lawndale, California. He was destined for greatness, with a scholarship offer from DePaul and dreams of attending UCLA with his childhood friend and teammate Russell Westbrook. On May 9, 2004, he debuted in the Drew League and was the best three-point shooter and shot blocker on his team. Tragically, he died on the floor of the Los Angeles Southwest College gymnasium due to an enlarged heart. His death had a profound impact on Russ.

What was Russ’ response in light of this tragedy?

Several of his signature shoes feature a small ""RIP"" printed on one tongue and ""KB3"" on the other. After Barrs died, Westbrook took over doing his chores at his grandmother's house until he went off to UCLA. Barrs used to wash his younger sister Marilyn's hair once a week, so in stepped Westbrook to fill the role. To this day, Marilyn considers Westbrook to be another big brother. Westbrook has mentioned Barrs in several interviews, but mostly talks about him in generalities

- Everyone knew Vogel was out. Nobody can deny it needed to happen

z9i19p,"[McMenamin] LeBron James ended his news conference tonight by asking the reporters present why he had not been asked about a photo of Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones that surfaced showing him, at age 14, standing near white students who were blocking Black students from entering school.","['Hi all,\n\nOur enhanced auto-moderation tool has been toggled on for this thread.

Because of course they did.', 'I mean, on the surface it seems like an irrelevant question to ask LeBron about, but they do seem to ask him about virtually every other sociopolitical problem going on in the world, so at least it’s sports related.', ""Because you ain't Jerry Jones's father."", 'A highly followed NBA superstar using his platform to promote anti semitism should be called out amongst the rest of the NBA players yes', '""And also, you guys were too hard on DeShaun Watson. Why? Because he\'s black?""', ""because this isn't undisputed? why would they ask lebron about a nfl owner."", 'How many games did LeBron play with Jerry Jones?', 'He’s not wrong about the inequity. But Jerry Jones is not his peer. I think that’s why no one asked him about it.\n\n[edit for clarity] What I mean is, if Jerry Jones played for the Brooklyn Nets, was once a teammate of LeBron’s, and had been linked to LeBron’s current team in pre-season trade rumors, the press would probably be more inclined to think LeBron had a relevant opinion on the matter.', 'Kyrie is his friend and a basketball player. Jones is the owner of a team he has said he isn’t a fan of anymore in a different spot and it’s a picture from 60 years ago.']","""I got one question for you guys before you
guys leave. I was thinking when I was on my way over here, I was wondering why I haven't gotten a question from you guys about the Jerry Jones photo. But when the Kyrie thing was going on, you guys were quick to ask us questions about that....

""When I watch Kyrie talk and he says, 'I know who I am, but I want to keep the same energy when we're talking about my people and the things that we've been through,' and that Jerry Jones photo is one of those moments that our people, Black people, have been through in America. And I feel like as a Black man, as a Black athlete, as someone with power and a platform, when we do something wrong, or something that people don't agree with, it's on every single tabloid, every single news coverage, it's on the bottom ticker. It's asked about every single day. But it seems like to me that the whole Jerry Jones situation, photo – and I know it was years and years ago and we all make mistakes, I get it but it seems like it's just been buried under, like, 'Oh, it happened. OK, we just move on.' And I was just kind of disappointed that I haven't received that question from you guys.""

From calling San Francisco ""hell"" after the Mavericks and Phoenix Suns Game 7 to chanting ""let's go Mavs"" in front of Dub Nation prior to Game 1, to trading ""you suck's"" with fans after the game and trolling the Warriors by wearing a Boban Marjanović jersey after Game 2, Barkley and Warriors fans have developed quite the fierce rivalry. 

At the end of the day, Barkley's just an entertainer at heart. 

“Oh, I can buy into the (Warriors),"" Barkley said on the ""Ryen Russillo Podcast"" prior to Game 2. ""I hate their fans. But we have a lot of give and take, and that doesn’t bother me. They, you know, you know, Ry? As long as people are reacting to your opinion, you're doing what you're supposed to do on television.

""I mean, your job is to make sure people enjoy the sport. You, hopefully, you have good games, but when you, when you're announcer, you want an analyst, whatever, I'm not sure what the hell I am, to be honest with you. You want people to respond to whatever you say. So whether you boo me or cheer me, as long as they. … I'm like Roman Reigns. As long as they acknowledge me, I'm doing my job.""

As much as Barkley has portrayed an affinity for the Mavs, it's all part of the act. He truly doesn't care which team out of the Western Conference advances to the Finals. 

""But I normally don't care, like this Golden State-Dallas [series],"" Barkley added. ""I don't care who wins. Boston against Miami. I don't care who wins. You know what I care about, right? I'm ready for this to be over, so I can go play golf and fish every day.""

That's why their calculation is wrong"", 'https://imgur.com/a/IFNgeQg', 'Iguodala joining was the X-factor.', '[deleted]']","Last October, FiveThirtyEight’s [2021-22 NBA Model](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-predictions/) predicted that the Warriors would be #22 in the league with 35 wins and 47 losses. It gave the team a 22% chance to make the playoffs, a 0.5% chance (1 in 200) to make the NBA Finals, and a 0.1% chance (1 in 1,000) to win the championship.

Adding to the Warriors obstacles this postseason were Steve Kerr’s terrible rotation choices. He frequently placed middling players like Andrew Wiggins (0.8 net RAPTOR) and Kevon Looney (0.7) in the starting lineup, while snubbing superstars Gary Payton II (3.4) and Andre Iguodala (1.6) with few minutes. He even kept scrub Klay Thompson (-1.2) in a starting role for all six finals games, despite the net RAPTOR metric proving that his minutes would have been put to better use in the hands of reliable role players like Damion Lee (-0.7) or Joan Toscano-Anderson (-0.5). According to the model, Kerr's superstitious trust in his own coaching experience over the cold reality of advanced statistics contributed to the Warriors' extremely long odds of winning the title.

But tonight, the Warriors have defied those odds to become the most unlikely NBA champions in league history. According to the model,\* fans can expect to wait another 138 years before they see a Cinderella story of this magnitude again. Congrats to Steph, Klay, and Dray! What a surreal and unbelievable vision it was to see those three hoisting up the Larry O'Brien trophy.

^(\* The sum of the probability of all teams ranked higher than the Warriors to win the championship was 99.5%. The probability of a win for any lesser team is) [^(P = 1 - 0.995\^y)](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=1-.995%5Ey%3D0.5) ^(where y is the number of years in the simulation.

He’s moving him around because he’s such a versatile player. It’s great for the league. I think you’ll start to see him continue to be more of an impact player as time goes on.”

Definitely puts more pressure on the league when its face publicly calls out like this, which is great given the fact that it’s unanimously agreeable that the [$10 million fine and one-year suspension](https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1569718124177391617?s=21) was nothing for someone of Sarver’s wealth and position in the league.Curious to see if this would lead to more voices to raise against this and eventually force the league to make any further punishments.

> 
> But Allen, 63, who is reportedly worth more than $20 billion, issued a defiant statement Tuesday, saying that she won’t sell the team her brother, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen left her after his 2018 death.
> 
> Former Trail Blazers president Larry Miller told The Post Jody is making a mistake: “I would say [to her], absolutely take the offer.”
> 
> Sources told The Post, there is growing disarray behind the scenes. A highly placed team staffer alleged that Jody’s “toxic behavior” — dating back to allegations of harassing bodyguards and violating US import laws — has spilled over into the management of the team. 
> 
> In December 2021, Neil Olshey, President of Basketball Operations, was fired from the Trail Blazers for violating the team’s code of conduct after an investigation revealed a decade of workplace toxicity and sexual harassment.
> 
> In November, Blazers CEO/President Chris McGowan — who also served as CEO of Vulcan Sports & Entertainment, the company founded by the Allens — quit after nine years, allegedly because of frustration with Jody and Kolde.
> 
> “The Trail Blazers are not as successful as they could have been. Jody is deferring everything to Bert, and he is not the right guy for the team,” Miller said.
> 
> Kolde was Paul Allen’s college roommate and friend. “He always had these issues that didn’t make sense. Paul would consult [Kolde], but [Paul] would make the decisions,” Miller added. “Jody’s letting Bert make all the decisions now.

> According to Miller, Jody even refused to take Knight’s call when the Nike founder, who has an estimated fortune of $54.5 billion, put his initial offer together: “She did not take Phil’s call. She deferred him to Bert.”

> “Damian wanted to sit down and have a conversation with Jody about the team and she didn’t return his call. Then he tried to email her.

Someone at ESPN or the NBA needs to offer you a job, these posts are awesome and not on a topic that is already covered to death\n\nIt’s interesting how much scoring seems to have increased in the few years before the creation of the NBA']","Much ado has been made of the Miami Heat's starting lineup only managing to produce 18 points in yesterday's 82-102 loss to the Celtics, with Bam Adebayo leading the starters with 9 points, Jimmy Butler adding 6, and Kyle Lowry producing 3, while Max Strus and P.J. Tucker both went scoreless.

You might recall from [my post about Jonathan Kuminga being the youngest playoff starter since 1909-10](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ulx5qo/the_last_time_someone_younger_than_jonathan/) that I have access to starting lineups for many years from before the NBA even existed. Which means I can also pinpoint the exact time this few points was last scored by a starting lineup.

On March 12, 1944, [German troops received the order from Adolf Hitler to commence Operation Margarethe, the Nazi invasion of Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Margarethe).

That same day, the Fort Wayne Zollners (now the Detroit Pistons) and the Sheboygan Redskins met for Game 2 of the 1944 NBL Finals. Fort Wayne held a 1-0 series lead in a best-of-five series after Jerry Bush sank a game winner to clinch a 55-53 win three days prior. With this game being in Sheboygan, it was thought that they had a chance to change the momentum of the series with a win, and any momentum shift in their favor could be huge, as this was a repeat of the previous year's championship series and Sheboygan had won that time around.

That didn't happen. Instead, they lost by an embarrassing score of 36-26. They scored only six points in each of the first two quarters and only four in the fourth quarter. Halfway through the third, they trailed 27-15.

The starting five Sheboygan used for that game was Kenny Suesens, Tony Kelly, Dick Schulz, Rube Lautenschlager, and Ed Dancker. Dancker, as the team's star center, scored the most points on the team—six points, to be exact. Suesens added five, Kelly had three, and both Schulz and Lautenschlager only scored two points each, making for a grand total of 18 points from Sheboygan's starting lineup.

The Redskins lost game three as well, making Fort Wayne champions for the first time ever.

If matching the Heat's 18 isn't quite enough and you want to find the last time a playoff team's starting lineup scored even fewer than 18 points, you have to go back four years earlier to March 7, 1940. That game also involved Sheboygan, who were beaten 41-24 by the Oshkosh All-Stars. The Redskins' lineup that day of Kenny Suesens—Dave Quabius—Sparky Adams—Otto Kolar—Rube Lautenschlager only combined for a grand total of 10 of those points."

I first and foremost want to give my deepest thanks to all of you who garnered the courage to share your experiences, as difficult as it may have been, to help piece together a clearer picture of what work life must have been like for you over these past 18 years.\n\n>There should be zero tolerance for discriminatory actions of any level, in any setting, let alone a professional one. There is no question that the findings determined that Mr. Sarver’s lewd, misogynist, and racist conduct had a substantial negative impact on you and has no place in our society. The report confirmed by multiple eyewitnesses that Robert Sarver used the “N-word” at least five times. The report confirmed Sarver engaged in conduct demeaning of female and pregnant employees. The report confirmed Sarver made crude and sexually inappropriate comments in professional settings. The report confirmed Sarver made inappropriate comments about the physical appearance of female employees and other women and made inappropriate workplace physical conduct toward male employees.\n\n>WORDS AND ACTIONS MATTER.\n\n>Similar conduct by any CEO, executive director, president, teacher, coach, or any other position of leadership would warrant immediate termination. The fact that Robert Sarver “owns” the team does not give him a license to treat others differently than any other leader. The fact that anyone would find him fit to lead because of this “ownership” position is forgetting that NBA teams belong to the communities they serve. Team investors are merely temporary stewards. If we, as sports leaders, are not held to the same standards then how can we expect a functional society with integrity and respect on any level? We owe it to you: employees, players, partners, and your families to provide the same positive workplace environment we would require of any other business.\n\n>I cannot in good judgment sit back and allow our children and future generations of fans to think that this behavior is tolerated because of wealth and privilege. Therefore, in accordance with my commitment to helping eradicate any form of racism, sexism and bias, as Vice Chairman of the Phoenix Suns, I am calling for the resignation of Robert Sarver.

3. Even if the bulls are completely docile, their NBA opponents will just flop. Of course the refs would call the fouls if a large animal bumps into a player.
4. If the bulls are not docile, they will most likely all get ejected for flagrant fouls, making their opponents win by default.

In March 2017, the Cavaliers got rid of a role player named Jordan McRae, whom Irving described as “one of the few people I hung out with.” Talking to Jefferson and Frye, he described a dream he had upon hearing the news: McRae entered his hotel room to say good-bye, but Irving couldn’t wake up to tell him he loved him.

> Jones had moved to Boston to live with him, and there was concern that the two were spending the dark Massachusetts winters isolated at home, bingeing YouTube. Someone who knew Irving at the time brought up the flat-Earth theory with him and Jones. “Alex is like, ‘I don’t know, man. We don’t know the Earth is round. Kyrie and I have been watching stuff,’” the source said. “Kyrie kept asking if we knew for sure that it was ‘constitutionally’ round.” The conclusion: “Oh, shit. They really believe that.” (To be fair to Irving, it’s never been entirely clear he does. He once gave an onstage apology to “all the science teachers … coming up to me like, ‘You know I’ve got to reteach my whole curriculum?!’”)

So in conclusion, a guy whose name just happens to be Alex Jones convinced Kyrie that the Earth is flat. Perfection.

Not good']","[**Rajon Rondo**](https://www.tmz.com/people/rajon-rondo/) allegedly pulled a gun on the mother of his children and threatened to kill her during a heated altercation ... and the woman claims their kids witnessed the whole thing.

**TMZ Sports** has learned 36-year-old **Ashley Bachelor**, Rondo's longtime partner and mother of his two kids, filed for an emergency protective order in Louisville last week, requesting protection for her, her son and daughter ... and the story she tells about the alleged incident is scary.

Bachelor says Rajon -- a 2x NBA champ and 4x All-Star -- was playing video games with his son on May 11 ... when Ashley asked the boy to separate laundry. Bachelor says Rajon became enraged and ripped the game console out of the wall in front of the kid.

Ashley says Rajon then continued the destructive behavior, smashing everything from a teacup to outdoor lights and trash cans.

Bachelor says the kids were upset after witnessing their dad losing it, so she tried to ""deescalate"" the situation. But, she says Rajon responded by making a death threat, allegedly saying, ""You're dead.""

Rondo temporarily left the home, according to Ashley, before returning about 15 minutes later, when he allegedly approached a back door and began banging on the window with his gun.

Bachelor says she didn't know what was going on, so she approached the door from the inside to take a look. She allegedly saw Rondo with the weapon and asked him to stop because he was scaring her. She says Rondo didn't listen, and instead yelled, ""Go get my f\*\*king son!""

Ashley says she feared if she didn't comply with the alleged gun-wielding hoops star something bad may happen, so she brought their son, **Pierre**, downstairs, but kept the backdoor closed.

Soon after, Ashley says Pierre opened the door and Rondo ""yanked him outside.""

Bachelor says Rondo, who was still allegedly holding his gun, was screaming at Pierre, asking why the boy was scared of his dad.

Ashley, who claims her son was ""visibly upset,"" says she didn't intervene because she was scared Rajon would shoot her.

Bachelor says Rajon eventually demanded their daughter also come outside ... where she claims he yelled at both kids for being afraid of him.

Thankfully, Ashley says Rajon's mom and dad both arrived at the home ... and although they didn't have much success in calming down Rajon, she claims he eventually left the scene.

But, now Bachelor says she's scared for the safety of her and her kids, writing the following in the emergency order of protection on May 13.

""I am extremely fearful for my safety and for the safety of my children. Rajon has a history of volatile, erratic, explosive behavior. He is verbally, emotionally, and financially abusive. He physically hits our son and calls him names like 'p\*\*\*y' and accuses him of acting like a 'bitch.'""

""Rajon verbally assaults our daughter. He calls her names like 'thot, bitch, and d\*\*khead.' Rajon has made several threats on my life, saying at various times he will shoot me or shoot up my car.""

Ashley Bachelor was granted protection for herself and her two children by a local judge.

We reached out to Rondo's reps, but, so far, no word back.

Based on our digging, Rondo has not been named a suspect in any crime by police, and has not been arrested."

w5bev5,"[OC] The LeBron Word Generator: I coded a LeWord Generator website.

***Intro*** **\~** If you frequent [r/nba](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/) a lot, have some friends who frequent the subreddit, or simply spend enough time scrolling through NBA social media. Odds are you have come across a LeJoke. A play on words originating as a meme where you take the first part of Lebron James' name (""Le"") and attach it to a word of your choosing.. Hate them, love them, or dread them. LeMemes are inevitable. Anytime Lebron James makes any headline, whether good or bad, there's a myriad of nicknames flooding the comments section inspired by the unique spelling format of 'LeBron'. And much like any massive trend, there's brilliant execution and there's uninspired blunders. Nonetheless, whether you're trying to up your LeGame, farm creativity (or karma), or you want to impress that cute girl in your office who has a weird LeNse of humor. I have just the solution for you!

>The Le-jokes are funny in the way dad jokes are. They’re mostly purposefully corny but every once in a while one might make you genuinely chuckle.

***A lot of blood, sweat. and JavaScript*** \~ I coded a website from scratch and implemented an algorithm that scavenges through interfaces/modules (notably words from MyThes, the open-office thesaurus, and the offline database of [thesaurus.com](https://thesaurus.com/)) to generate synonyms and transform them into 'LeWords'. On top of the synonym generator, there is also a Hero/Villain and Pokémon feature. Access a databank of popular superheroes and supervillains or a list of +900 Pokémon and watch them LeTransfrom.

***Here's a sample of what the*** [*website*](https://www.lebronifymachine.com/) ***can produce*** **\~ Example**

Input word: *God*

Results:

* LeSupreme Being - (Supreme Being)
* LeSupernatural Being - (supernatural being)
* LeSuperior - (superior)
* LeImage - (image)
* LeFfigy - (effigy)
* LeSuperordinate - (superordinate)
* LeImmortal - (immortal)

***Summary*** **\~** [The Lebronify Machine](https://www.lebronifymachine.com/) project is in large part dedicated to the [r/nba](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/) community. Lebron James is a high-level athlete and a bonafide superstar in the NBA. The play on words originated as a meme where you take the first part of Lebron James' name (""Le"") and attach it to a word of your choosing.

***The algorithm*** **\~** Logic: The 1st and 3rd letter of every word must always be capitalized.

* If an 'o' is found in the 1st or 2nd slot. Attach 'LeBr' to word. (ie.: Ostrich → LeBrostrich)

* If an 'i' is found in the 1st or 2nd slot. Swap 'i' with 'Le'. (ie.: Imagination → LeMagination)

* If an 'e' is found in the 1st or 2nd slot. Place 'L' accordingly. (ie.: Elephant → LeLephant )

* Else: Attach 'Le' to the front of the word.


***Features*** **\~** Check them out at [https://www.lebronifymachine.com/](https://www.lebronifymachine.com/)

* **Synonyms:** Enter a word into the search box. The machine will generate a list of synonyms and run its algorithm to transform each synonym into a 'LeWord'.
* **Hero/Villain:** A list of popular hero and villain names is randomly generated and LeTransformed. *No input required.*
* **Pokémon:** A list of Pokémon names is randomly generated and LeTransformed. *No input required.*

***DISCLAIMER! \~*** The website/link is in no means intended to be a call to action. This is a fun lighthearted project I made with the community in mind. Also, I love LeBron!

***Honorable Mentions***

Thank you u/swansonben for the Gold Award.

Thank you u/Sim888 for the Helpful Awards.

***Updates made thanks to community feedback:***

* trim() implemented. No more blank spaces getting in your way.
* Easter eggs.
* More vowels added to the algorithms. 'i' gets turned into 'e' depending on location and length of word. (Intense --> LeNtense). And 'o' gets a 'LeBr' attachment. (Oyster --> LeBroyster) or (Ontario --> LeBrontario).

The two members of the traveling party who spoke to The Athletic said that they did not see who shined the laser from the SUV. They also don’t know if the laser was attached to a gun, but they believed it was. A Pacers **security guard** in the loading area at the time **remarked: “That’s 100 percent a gun.”**  

>“NBA Security and league investigators conducted an investigation interviewing numerous eyewitnesses and reviewing video surveillance following allegations made by the Indiana Pacers organization regarding a postgame incident on Jan. 29. While we substantiated that a postgame situation arose that was confrontational, based on interviews and other evidence gathered, we could not corroborate that any individual threatened others with a weapon,” Bass said.

Details:

>The verbal sparring continued intermittently for approximately 15 to 20 minutes, until Morant entered the loading area. He, Pack and the others dispersed into two vehicles. Morant, Pack and one other person got into an SUV, sources said. The first vehicle turned toward the bus before exiting up a ramp and out of the arena’s loading area. The SUV moved toward the Pacers bus, turned, slowed, and that was when members of the Pacers traveling party noticed a red laser coming from the car and being trained on players, coaches and others"

You remember that game. George Hill’s missed free throw near the end of regulation to J.R. Smith forgetting the score. Nobody called a timeout to save Smith. Right before all of that happened, with 30 seconds left and the Cavs up two, James thought he’d drawn a charge on Kevin Durant, but officials changed the call to a blocking foul. Durant’s two foul shots, and the rest of the craziness at the end of regulation, sent it to overtime. When it was over and the Cavs lost that game, James punched the wall in the visitor’s locker room and broke a bone in his hand.
“There were only two times he felt cheated after a game, Saturday (against Boston) and Game 1,” another of his close friends said.

Giannis speaking on recent team woes as the Bucks are barely above .500 there last 30 games (16-14). 

Personally I do think it's time to take it seriously and make moves during the trade. And a step further these last 2 matches feels like a wake up call to fire somebody for letting a contender have a 9-0 start to a season slip so horribly into mediocrity.

But I am rather ignorant, and if Giannis is this confident despite the horrendous play we've seen, maybe things are happening to give him confidence."

>*“The first guy that started the Hack-a-Ben process was Scott Brooks with Washington,” he said. “They’re playing Philly a few years ago and Philly’s up by around 20. Brooks starts putting Simmons on the line in the fourth quarter, and the game is getting closer as Ben is stepping to the line and bricking more and more foul shots. So finally Bradley Beal had to foul him. Usually you don’t have your best player fouling, but at that point he did.*

I’d say the gap between Luka and Trae has always been fairly sizeable but now the gap between the two of them is greater than ever, Luke’s moved into best player in the league conversation whilst Trae is having his worst season since his rookie year.

It shook me to my core. What if Kobe really did have that dawg in  him?

What does that even mean?  What does it mean when Skip Bayless says that **Jimmy Butler** has got that  dog in him? I found my answer. It was 1985, I was 23 years old, fresh  out of college at Ball State, when I saw Rod Daniel's seminal  documentary *Teen Wolf* about a 17  year old werewolf named Scott Howard, and how gifted he was at  basketball thanks in part to his lycanthropy. This was what it meant to  truly have that dawg in him.

This  was the reason I came up with a mathematical formula. I'm sure most of  you are familiar with Game Score, an advanced metric created by John  Hollinger to give a simple, linear explanation of how many cool things a  basketball player did in a game, but for those of you that don't, it  makes little sense at all: simple stats are multiplied by a constant  value to weight them with how cool they are. Scoring a point? That's  pretty cool, you get a full point. Defensive rebounds aren't as cool as  Offensive rebounds, so you only get .3 for a defensive rebound compared  to .7 for an offensive rebound. Fouling? Certified not cool, to the  point where you lose .4.

Why does  Game Score matter? It's the basis of my new formula: The Werewolf Index.  Applying the average game score for each lunar phase, weighted for how  strong a werewolf would be under that phase, and then adding or  subtracting them together. It looks a little something like this.

    WI = ((2 * Full Moon) + (1.5 * Gibbous Moon) + Half Moon - (1.5 * Crescent Moon) - (2 * New Moon)) - Average Game Score For Season

Why is it weighted this  way? Well, think about it like this: If a player's average game score is  20, you'd expect it to be 20 under all phases of the lunar cycle.  Dropping 20 in a Full Moon game gets you 40, but you're probably getting  that for the New Moon as well, so they'd cancel out. The same happens  for the Gibbous and Crescent Moons, so you're just left with the Half  Moon minus the Total Average. This, again, should be 0. That means that  any player who averages higher than 0 is playing better during the Full  or Gibbous moons, a telltale sign of being a werewolf.

I  combed through the seasons of every All-Star since 2002-03 and ran them  through the Werewolf Index. The League Average during this time period  was a .017, a testament to how airtight my logic is.

Thankfully,  a number of players were incredibly human during these time periods.  **Tracy McGrady** only had a .034. **King James**, the undisputed greatest  player of all time, had a -.015, an incredibly trustworthy human score.  **Kevin Garnett** has never cared about the moon, clearly, as indicated by  his -.024. And of course, the greatest point guard in NBA history,  **""Optimus Dime""** himself **John Wall**, had a -.043. And, to his credit, Dorian James was right. **Kobe Bryant** did not, in fact, have that dawg in  him. A -.008, the closest to true humanity of any of the players.

But  forget that, there's something far more important. Who are the most  likely werewolves in the NBA? Who, you ask, should we be deathly afraid  of?

**Andre Drummond** clocked in at a  2.013. At 6'10"", 280 pounds, he has all the telltale signs of a  werewolf: big, strong, fantastic dunker.

The young gun **Devin Booker** had a 1.484, without a single season tracking below the league average. 100% a werewolf.

**Vince  Carter** was actually on good pace; before his first All-Star season was  derailed due to injuries, he was pretty safely in the negative numbers.  After that, though? Every season he was **by far** a werewolf, averaging 1.611.

But  I brought up something interesting: Negative numbers exist. What does  it mean if someone plays better under the new moon? Surely they're not a  werewolf. What's the opposite of a werewolf?

This  question haunted me for years, until I finally found the answer. I  remember it like it was yesterday. It was 1997, I was six years old,  fresh out of Mrs. Bodnariuk's kindergarten class, when I went to see the  movie *Air Bud* in theaters. It  struck me like a lightning bolt. Of course the opposite of a man who  turns into a wolf is a dog dressed like a human playing basketball.

So  who are they? Who are these saviors of basketball, these lovable golden  retrievers who will protect us from the werewolf threat?

**DeMarcus  ""Boogie"" Cousins** clocked in at a -1.246. At 6'10"", 270 pounds, he has  all the telltale signs of a golden retriever: big, strong, fantastic  dunker. Boogie even sounds like a great name for a family dog. Boogie's  case is particularly interesting, because he played 55 games for the  Sacramento Kings in 2016-17 where he clocked in at a -4.244, which is  already a monster score, before being traded to the New Orleans  Pelicans... where he went **even further beyond**, reaching the untold heights of -5.888. He may be the most lovable golden retriever of them all, the ""Good Boy"" of prophecy.

The young gun **Donovan Mitchell** had a -2.215, without a single season tracking above the league average. 100% a golden retriever.

**Zach  LaVine** had the lowest career average in the set, at a -3.943 career  rating, including the lowest number of them all: -6.893 in the 2020-2021  season.

And of course, how could  this post not include the undisputed greatest player of all time, **Michael Jordan**. Where did Michael Jordan end up on the chart? Well, his  2002-03 season was the only one in the set, where Michael Jordan clocked  in at a -1.925. Players may talk at length about how terrified they  were of MJ on the court, but since 02-03 was obviously peak Jordan,  dude's absolutely on team Air Bud.

Oh, and to respond to Skip Bayless: **Jimmy Buckets** may have had a -0.406 score, but the two players you compared him to, **Ben Simmons** and **Joel Embiid**, had a -0.543 and a -0.755 respectively. Both certifiably more dawg in em than Butler.

Stay safe, fellow hoop fans. Watch out for what cleans the glass in the night.

Edit: I promise I've seen Teen Wolf

Edit2: This blew up a hell of a lot more than I thought it would and I'm getting a few requests for players that weren't in the data I used. This actually takes a good amount of time to get em set up to look at, so I'm probably not gonna do any extra tonight, but I'll try to get to em in the next couple days.

While COVID delayed the start of the 2020 season…

—8 teams played on Election Day 2018, 
—12 teams in 2016
—16 teams the night of the 2014 midterms.

It's a tradition that dates back to 2017, with [Monta Ellis](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/64yxyp/forget_mvp_who_should_win_least_valuable_player/) winning the trophy in what would be his last year in the league. [Jamal Crawford](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8ai7pl/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/) won the following year when his defense had soured past the point of no return. [Solomon Hill](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/b8xut2/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/) won in 2019, starting games for a then-imploding Pelicans team (during the AD drama). [Isaiah Thomas](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hukwu8/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/) won in 2020 for a short stint with the Wizards, and [Aron Baynes](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nhp7j2/and_the_results_are_in_for_the_least_valuable/) won last season after struggling as a starter for Toronto.

Who will join that illustrious list? Before we get to that, let's remember the criteria and caveats:

--- Obviously, the worst players in the league are the ones who sit at the end of the bench and don't get any playing time. However, this award focuses on players who log a decent amount of minutes and consequently affected their team's play the most. Simply put: the more you play, the more damage you can do. 

--- And that actual ""damage"" is important. If you're on a tanking team, no one cares about your poor play; it may even be a positive. We also tend to ignore young players (under 21) who are still developing and can't be expected to be solid players yet.

--- Similarly, we don't want to judge players within the context of their salary any more than the actual MVP does. We also do not weigh in injuries either. We want to focus on players' on-court performance instead. Those rules (which has existed since the beginning of the LVP award) may be especially controversial this year.

--- We also wanted to note that this yearly column can come across as a little mean spirited, which is not our intention. Even the worst player in the NBA is in the top 99% percentile at their sport and making more money than most of us could dream about. And to be fair, even the worst player in the league probably costs his team only a couple of games (hardly anyone has a VORP worse than -2), so they shouldn't be the scapegoat for an entire organization. In many cases, they're simply played too much or played in the wrong role. But when the stakes are this high, it's fair to criticize players or their teams for that negative impact.

So with all that said, let's take a look at the dishonorable mentions and the official top 5.

---

######**(DIS)HONORABLE MENTION: FALLEN STAR EDITION**

**PG Ben Simmons, PHI/BKN: 0.0 minutes per game, n/a BPM**

The LVP headquarters has made a rule to discount any injuries, but that still leaves the matter of Ben Simmons up for debate. How much do you believe in mental health as an excused absence? How much do you believe in the severity and timing of his back injury? It's difficult to give concrete answers to that; I imagine most older folks would call him ""soft"" while many younger fans would give him the benefit of the doubt. At the end of the day, we'll reluctantly avoid tagging him with the trophy; we're not a big enough organization to fight a Rich Paul lawsuit.

---

**PG Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn: 37.2 minutes per game, +2.7 BPM**

Kyrie Irving's decision to avoid a vaccine had massive ramifications. If he got the jab, would James Harden have stuck around? Would Kevin Durant have stayed healthy (if he didn't have to overextend his minutes)? Would Brooklyn have fulfilled expectations as the preseason title favorites? It's hard to know. And it's hard to know the inner workings of Kyrie Irving's not-so-beautiful mind. Still, at the end of the day, Irving was willing to play basketball if the local rules allowed, so it's hard to fault him more than other players who also remained unvaccinated. He's also -- like him or not -- really F'ing good at basketball. To that end: his BPM (box plus minus, meant to illustrate a player's impact per 100 possessions) is easily the highest on our list.

---

**PF Julius Randle, N.Y. Knicks: 35.3 minutes per game, +0.5 BPM**

In our original straw poll, some people mentioned Julius Randle's dud season as a potential LVP campaign. And sure enough, both Randle and the Knicks were big disappointments. After signing a big extension, Randle's shooting dropped like a rock (from 41% to 31% from deep) and the Knicks dropped out of the playoffs with him. Still, he doesn't really qualify for this particular award. While overpaid, he's still a solid starting player. In fact, *last* season was probably more of an outlier than anything else based on his career numbers.

---

######**(DIS)HONORABLE MENTION: OTHER DISAPPOINTMENTS WHO DON'T FIT THE BILL**

**C Mason Plumlee, Charlotte: 24.6 minutes per game, +0.0 BPM**

After years and years of Cody Zeller, the Charlotte Hornets finally moved on. But alas, their heart couldn't move on entirely, so they rebounded with *another* white dude who happened to be the best of his three brothers; it was the NBA equivalent of Rachel dating [Russ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9-hJD_9Qkw).

Plumlee started 73 games for Charlotte, and promptly reminded everyone why he's best served as a backup instead. His 39.2% shooting from the free throw line was particularly ugly. All that said, Plumlee isn't a *bad* player and has some virtues (primarily his passing). If this award was limited to the worst *starters*, then Mason Plumlee would have a good chance at qualifying. But since we open it to all rotational players, he gets a pass here.

---

**PF Davis Bertans, WAS/DAL: 14.4 minutes per game, -2.6 BPM**

We want to reiterate that LVP doesn't factor in salary. And that fact may spare the Latvian legend, Davis Bertans. When Bertans first came into the NBA, he was under the radar and turned out to be a bargain signing for Washington. He splashed over 40% of his threes his first two years for the team, giving them some valuable spacing at the PF position. Unfortunately, the Wizards got a little *too* excited about it and gave Bertans a long-term extension. It was a risky proposition given his one-dimensional skill set and his extensive injury history (two ACL tears.) 

In hindsight, it's one of the worst contracts in recent memory. Bertans was absolutely brutal this season for Washington, hitting only 31.9% of his threes and looking stiffer than a corpse on D. New coach Wes Unseld (a defensive specialist) deemed him virtually unplayable, giving him 0 starts and under 15 minutes a night before the team dumped him on Dallas. Oddly enough, the fact that Bertans didn't play much for Washington may help him in LVP voting as the team minimized his negative impact. He also played better in Dallas, due no doubt to Luka Doncic's gravity and playmaking.

---

**SG Talen Horton-Tucker, L.A. Lakers: 25.2 minutes per game, -3.3 BPM**

It's debatable whether or not Talen Horton-Tucker should qualify for LVP voting or not. In his defense, he's still only 21 years old (and thus should be spared by our age rule.) At the same time, he's already in his third year in the league, and he's already making $9.5M a year. Famously, the Lakers even prioritized him over some of their other vets. When they did that, the expectation was that he could be a contributor for the team's title push this year. 

Turns out: he could not. THT's best virtue is his length when he slashes inside as a scorer, but he rarely gets the chance to do that when he's on the court with LeBron James and Russell Westbrook. With them, he has to play off the ball and chuck up threes, which isn't his strong suit (27% on the year.) Despite the clunky fit, the Lakers still played him 25+ minutes a game and gave him 19 spot starts. 

---

######**(DIS)HONORABLE MENTION: END OF THE ROAD EDITION**

**SG Lou Williams, Atlanta: 14.3 minutes per game, -3.4 BPM**

Sweet Lou Williams fits the mold of a lot of our former LVP winners (Monta Ellis, Jamal Crawford, Isaiah Thomas.) They're best known as microwave scorers, but there becomes a point when the machine starts to malfunction and the warranty runs out on the equipment. And when the scoring stops, the other limitations to their game become more obvious and problematic.

Williams probably dipped into the ""negative"" camp last season, and he's been sinking even lower now (at age 35.) He's no longer an efficient scorer -- he's no longer getting to the line (1.4 FTA per game) -- he's no longer playable. He's spared from ranking higher on this list due to the fact that Nate McMillan realized that and kept him under 15 minutes a night.

---

**C DeAndre Jordan, LAL/PHI: 13.0 minutes per game, -1.4 BPM**

DeAndre Jordan doesn't fit the mold of the old microwave scorer, but he's another former star who's stumbled over the hill. Sometimes, the most dangerous players aren't the bad ones -- they're the ones who used to be good. And because of their reputation, they end up overstaying their welcome. 

That describes Jordan this season, one in which he somehow found playing time for two separate teams. He started 19 games for the Lakers, and then took over Andre Drummond's backup role in Philly. And while we may lump Drummond and Jordan together as two classic bigs who don't fit the modern NBA, there's a notable gap between them of terms of age (Drummond is 5 years younger) and quality of play. In fact, Drummond graded as over 4 points better per 100 possessions in the same role (Drummond at +1.3, Jordan at -3.0). 

Sidenote: the playoffs did not affect his candidacy ; as with MVP, the LVP is a *regular season* award. That said, Sixers fans may hope that Doc Rivers reads reddit.

---

**PF James Johnson, Brooklyn: 19.2 minutes per game, -2.2 BPM**

The Brooklyn Nets signed ""Bloodsport"" as a defender and enforcer, figuring they'd be all set on offense. After all, they had Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Joe Harris, Patty Mills, etc. What could go wrong??

Turns out: a lot. And given all the injuries and absences, the Nets needed more from a rotation player and spot starter (10 starts) than Johnson was able to provide. He's never been a good offensive player (aside from one outlier shooting season in Miami), but he dipped down to 27% from deep this season despite a lot of easy and open shots. Johnson's defense -- now at age 35 -- can't make up for his other limitations. Ultimately, the Nets cut their losses and waived Johnson this past month. It's rare for a team to cut a veteran right before a playoff run, a move that speaks volumes about how much they thought he had left to offer. (Although in hindsight, they may have regretted downsizing against Boston.)

---

######**(DIS)HONORABLE MENTION: BOTTOM OF THE BARREL EDITION**

**SF Semi Ojeleye, MIL/LAC: 13.5 minutes per game, -3.1 BPM**

After four forgettable years in Boston, Semi Ojeleye had his worst season yet in shared time with Milwaukee and L.A. He was arguably one of the worst players in the entire league this year, shooting just 30% from the field and not contributing much else. All that said, Ojeleye doesn't quite fit the bill for what we're looking for here; his 406 total minutes don't represent enough playing time to be a huge impact. Still -- make no mistake -- Ojeleye needs to find his footing fast before he falls out of the league.

---

**SG Keljin Blevins, Portland: 9.0 minutes per game, -7.5 BPM**

Best known as Damian Lillard's cousin and nepotism signing, Keljin Blevins is making a name for himself as one of the worst players in NBA history. Similar to Semi Ojeleye, Blevins won't qualify for this award because he hardly played until the team started to tank. Still, he deserves a (dis)honorable mention given his grisly numbers. He's shot 31% from the field, 29% from 3, and 55% from the line for a grand total of a 41% true shooting. Add in the fact that he's undersized for SF (where he played most of his minutes), and it's arguable that Blevins is a historically bad player. 

In fact, it's pretty egregious that the Blazers gave him a contract in the first place. Even in college, Blevins didn't stand out. He averaged 11.8 points per game as a fifth-year senior, the third highest total on a Montana State team that went 15-17 overall. There's almost no chance that a player with that resume would sniff the NBA if he didn't score highly on his 23-and-me test. 

---

######**THE OFFICIAL LIST: THE TOP 5 ""LEAST VALUABLE PLAYERS""**

**(5) SG Furkan Korkmaz, Philadelphia: 21.1 minutes per game, -3.1 BPM**

The absence of Ben Simmons opened up minutes and opportunities for other players. Some (like Tyrese Maxey) took advantage. Some (like Furkan Korkmaz) pooped the bed instead.

The fact that Korkmaz averaged a career-high 20+ minutes a game says more about the Sixers' depth than about his play on the court. Defensively, Korkmaz is limited (as illustrated by his -1.1 BPM), so his chief contributions come as a shooter/spacer. Unfortunately, the Turkish sharpshooter forgot his rifle this year. He hit 28.9% of his threes, which is an especially low mark for someone who plays next to offensive stars. Korkmaz's struggles also grade highly in terms of the ""impact"" on the season. If the Sixers were ONE game better (which Korkmaz could have provided), they'd have the # 2 seed instead of the # 4. To be fair, Korkmaz has been better in the past, so we shouldn't be so quick to write off his future. 2021-22 was simply a year to forget for him.

---

**(4) SG Nickeil Alexander-Walker, NO/UTA: 22.6 minutes per game, -2.9 BPM**

In my preseason ""best bet"" series, I did a decent job predicting some awards, including [Tyler Herro](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ph5khd/oc_the_best_bet_series_predicting_the_sixth_man/) as the Sixth Man of the Year. But for [Most Improved](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/p9zjdh/oc_the_best_bet_series_predicting_the_most/
) I veered off course so badly that I accidentally recreated [Mac and Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5le9sYdYkM). Like many, I expected third-year guard Nickeil Alexander-Walker to have a breakout season.

Most damningly of all, so did David Griffin and the New Orleans Pelicans. Alexander-Walker projected as a potential scorer given his size and slashing capability (reminiscent of his cousin Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.) Allegedly, Griffin made the idea of giving Alexander-Walker more playing time a focal point of his coaching search. They even deemed Lonzo Ball expendable. It was NAW's time to shine! And did he? NAW.

Alexander-Walker had a golden opportunity early in the season with Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram out, and the Pelicans gave him every chance to show his scoring chops. He started their first 18 games, and jacked up 20+ shots three separate times. Effectively, he was their go-to guy. The problem is: NAW couldn't hit a bucket or finish at the rim. He shot 37% from the field and 29% from 3 in that time, one of the key reasons the team got off to such a terrible 3-15 start. 

The Pelicans eventually benched (and then traded) NAW, and eventually they found their footing when Brandon Ingram came back and C.J. McCollum arrived from Portland. They even rallied to make the playoffs. By doing that, they may have sunk NAW's LVP campaign. And in his defense, he's still a young player (age 23) who got thrust into the spotlight too early due to injuries and poor roster planning. Hopefully he'll be able to find his rhythm in a year or two and avoid making lists like these.

---

**(3) PG Avery Bradley, L.A. Lakers: 22.7 minutes per game, -3.6 BPM**

There's been plenty of blame to go around for the Lakers' struggles this year, but I haven't seen much of it directed at Avery Bradley, who started 45/62 games. Bradley's been holding on to his reputation as a solid 3+D guard for a while now -- but he hasn't been particularly effective at it since his days in Boston. 

While Bradley can still hit some open shots (39% from 3), he's not the easiest player to fit in a lineup. Because he acts more as a spacer than playmaker (0.8 assists per game), he really needs to be the de facto PG for a team with a big point forward. LeBron James qualifies. Russell Westbrook, not as much. With Westbrook on the court, Bradley has to play ""up"" as a wing (79% of his minutes at SG, according to basketball-reference) and his limited size at 6'3"" becomes a problem. To make matters worse, the Lakers trotted out several 3 and even 4-guard lineups this year, which crushed them defensively. If we had an ""anti-award"" for worst GM, Rob Pelinka may be a lock.

---

**(2) PG Russell Westbrook, L.A. Lakers: 34.3 minutes per game, -1.6 BPM**

We've already mentioned three other Lakers (Avery Bradley, Talen Horton-Tucker, and DeAndre Jordan) and several others could have made the list as well. The roster was thinner than a Hollywood starlet all season long, and Frank Vogel didn't know how to patch them together in an appropriate way. 

No doubt, a lot of those problems are the trickle-down effect of their disastrous decision to go all in on Russell Westbrook and his $40M contract. He didn't fit with LeBron James, and he sapped up all the salary the team could have used on supplemental talent around them. 

In our straw poll, Westbrook was the overwhelming winner of this award. Still, here at the LVP headquarters, we've vowed not to factor in contracts. So the question becomes: was Russell Westbrook a *bad* player this year (ignoring salary)? You can definitely make that argument. He shot under 30% from 3 and under 67% from the line. He led the league in total turnovers (3.8 per game) and probably led the league in wild airballs as well. His freelancing also made him a bad defensive player (-0.9 BPM). He still has some virtues -- namely that he can put pressure on defenses in transition -- but they didn't make up for his shortcomings.

Despite all that and despite the [Viking](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-09/man-in-viking-garb-among-three-charged-by-u-s-in-capitol-riots) mob storming the gate demanding his blood, I fear that Westbrook is not *quite* bad enough for this award. He's been a below-average starter and probably a zero-value player (illustrated by his 0.2 VORP). Given his contract, that's a disaster. But if we ignore contracts as mandated, I don't think he's the worst of the worst. If anything, he'd inspire us to debate a change to the ""contract"" rule for the future.

---

**(1) PG Facundo Campazzo, Denver: 18.2 minutes per game, -0.8 BPM**

There's a tipping point where an amusing sidekick starts to get overexposed and becomes annoying: we call it the [Rob Schneider effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Schneider).

Denver guard Facundo Campazzo reached that point this season. He provided a little spark and energy in the past in a cameo role, but the Nugget needed more from him this year with Jamal Murray injured. Unfortunately, Campazzo came up short. Despite a boatload of open shots, he only hit 36% from the field and 30% from 3. His limited size (listed at 5'10"") makes it difficult for him to operate inside the arc either. He's feisty on D, but that's not enough to overcome his other limitations.

Campazzo's box plus/minus isn't terrible (-0.8), but the struggles go deeper than that. In our initial poll for this award, Nuggets fan /u/Kovovyev buried him with some brutal advanced stats. Apparently over 95% of his threes are classified as ""open"" or ""wide open"" by NBA.com, making that 31% success rate a remarkable failure. And despite playing on a good team, Campazzo registered a -8 net rating. He's even negative (-2) when playing alongside Nikola Jokic. Eventually the Nuggets shelved Campazzo, but he did play enough games to do his damage. 

How much ""damage"" is there? Arguably, not a huge amount since the Nuggets still won 48 games. Still, it shouldn't take a historically good year from your star player to make the playoffs -- and that's what Nikola Jokic had to do. In fact, of the 16 players who logged 100+ minutes for Denver, Jokic is the *only* one who had a positive BPM. The fact that the Nuggets couldn't count on the veteran Campazzo to soak up some minutes and stop that bleeding is a true knock against him.

So while Russell Westbrook got the most attention this year for his poor play, the LVP office would have to ask: which player would you rather have less? Who is the LEAST valuable/helpful? 35 minutes of Russ, or 20 minutes of Campazzo? It's not an easy decision.

In fact, the debate came down to the wire and the last day of the regular season, when Campazzo gave us the LVP version of a ""Heisman moment"" with a [cheap shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJPoI8fGyws) shove to Wayne Ellington. It was telling. After falling out of the rotation, Campazzo should have used the last day and garbage time to prove that he actually belonged in the NBA. He did the opposite. Many of our LVP ""winners"" ended up not playing in an NBA rotation again, and Campazzo (an impending free agent) may be next."

This year’s draft coverage was as bad as I’ve ever seen it. Please excuse my rant.

Last year’s broadcast had Rece Davis hosting, with Mike Schmitz, Kendrick Perkins and Jay Bilas as analysts. 

ESPN lost Schmitz to the Portland Trail Blazers, yes, but that was a month ago. The 3-person desk was simply not enough. 

Malika Andrews did a passable job, but it seemed like someone was in her ear every. single. pick. to tell the viewer “what a great moment this is.” Show us, don’t tell us. 

Without Schmitz, we got more Kendrick Perkins talking, and while he’s no doubt getting better, he still is a puzzling choice for this spot. He seems like ESPN’s attempt at Charles Barkley’s “ho-hum charm” and it just isn’t working.

That leads me to my main bone to pick: ESPN’s presentation of Woj. I’m not upset at Woj specifically: he made his millions by tweeting out who the pick is 45 seconds before it is announced. I understand he’s always going to spoil picks. So I unfollowed him on Twitter yesterday, stayed off Twitter the first 10 picks or so, and then stayed 30 minutes behind on the app. I thought I was safe.

Wrong.

ESPN had on the crawl hours before the draft his report of the order being 1. Jabari 2. Chet 3. Banchero. So the fans had to think for hours that one of the most unknown top 3 in years was now known. Then, with the Magic on the clock, they put him on TV to ANNOUNCE THE PICK! Why ESPN thinks this is the best for their own product to have him deliver the news instead of Adam Silver is beyond me. They could have kept it quiet for 2 more minutes and presented it as a “major surprise pick.”

As the draft continued, we got the perfect mix of picks being spoiled on the broadcast, combined with trade details rarely being reported. The broadcast presented the Duren trade as the Pistons sending the 2025 Bucks pick for the rights to Duren, the 13th pick, which obviously makes no sense.

In addition, Woj is clearly not ready for prime time TV. He’s a reporter. Most of his on-camera appearances he stammers through his line, with absolutely no personality. My guess is ESPN is trying to find ways to justify his salary.

**TL;DR:** I shouldn’t have to have my finger on the mute button the whole draft trying to guess whether Woj is reporting on trade details or spoiling a pick."

Just wait til Monday when either Locked On, The Athletic, or The Ringer podcasts steal your content', 'Too good for off-season shit posts.']","I'm sure you've heard Bill Russell's #6 is being retired league-wide. He's the first such player, and almost certainly will remain the only player to receive this honor for decades to come, if not for the rest of most of our lives.

But it got me thinking about the first NBA player to have his number retired at all. The answer's probably unexpected, in no small part due to the fact that you cannot find his name on a list of any NBA team's retired jerseys.

Meet [Billy ""The Bullet"" Gabor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Gabor), whose #7 jersey was retired by the Syracuse Nationals at halftime of [this game against the Warriors](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/195503060SYR.html) on March 6, 1954. [Here's the proof.](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/107434578/the-post-standard/)

Gabor won zero championships. He never made an All-NBA Team. He was an All-Star just once. He spent half his six-year *(plus three games of a seventh season)* career coming off the bench. And he didn't even spend his whole time with that team wearing the number they retired in his honor. But nonetheless, he was the first.

He wasn't by any means unworthy of the honor though. Billy Gabor was a hometown hero who had been a Syracuse University legend and a WWII bombardier before his pro career began. He was a crucial part of the 1949-50 team that made the Finals. He was beloved by fans for his hustle, passion, and fiery reputation for playing until (and often past) the whistle. He was both a microwave scorer and one of the best situational man-to-man defenders of star guards, earning a reputation as a Cousy stopper toward the end of his prime. He put his body on the line more than just about anybody, resulting in a torn meniscus, two fractured cheeks, a broken nose *(in an incident that made him the first player to ever wear a facemask in an NBA game)*, a broken elbow, a broken finger, a dislocated shoulder, a sprained ankle,  and a twisted knee—all of which he missed just a combined 40 games over. And of course, one final thing to help his candidacy for a retired jersey was that his career ended surprisingly and suddenly with a severe recurring illness that had briefly threatened his life earlier in the season.

So why isn't it retired anymore? Well, Syracuse relocated and became the Philadelphia 76ers. The franchise only held onto select parts of its history, not including the retirement of Gabor's jersey. And that's how the first jersey ever retired in league history has been worn by 24 players since then, and is currently occupied by third-string combo guard Isaiah Joe."

MJ could still score 20+ PPG, but wasn’t terribly efficient. Worse still, he played for a mediocre team that had no real chance at making waves. The Wizards finished 37-45 both seasons.

That said, I wanted to give Jordan some credit for chugging along and showing up as a pro every night despite the irrelevance of the task at hand. In the last season, he played every single game and averaged 37.0 minutes a night. No player in the NBA right now averages more (although it’s clearly a different era in terms of load management.)

In fact, Jordan seemed to turn up the gas even as the season slipped away. After turning age 40, he played 40+ minutes in 17 of his final 30 games, and even cracked 50+ twice.

I always feel like there is zero chance someone like that could ever bust. He was also the *perfect* player for the Sixers needs (then and now lol). Having such a good shot at, minimum, a scalable 3&D player to play alongside Embiid\'s prime (and he went well above expected potential) and pissing off what Zach Lowe would call ""the basketball gods"" trading him after the entire mom story got all that traction...\n\nWell, it worked out for Mikal. Delighted how good he\'s become.', 'Sixers had a lot of those between Hinkie getting kicked out and Morey.

The 2018 draft had a ton of underrated guys (especially picks 10-12), but also later too. We had Roco at the time so bridges wasn’t going to be a starter so moving him wasn’t the problem, it was the selection of Zaire instead of the other guys that made it. But Zaire almost died and his career get wrecked by an allergy. We never got to see him healthy. Additionally, looking at Bridges numbers the first two years of his career, I’m not sure he would have even survived the trade deadline that first season or if we would have moved him anyway.', 'People forget that we had the worst Front Office put in by Adam Silver. Needs to be a 30 for 30 on how to squander 7 years+ of asset acquisitions in two off-seasons and then the brain trust behind it gets fired for having large collars and trying to trade Embiid and build around Simmons.']","Draft watchers will remember this as one of the most awkward trades in draft history. As Mikal’s mom actually WORKED FOR THE 76ers.

What do you realistically think will come of this? I don’t see the Celtics organization doing anything unless he does something even more blatant.

Brown continues to disappoint Celtics fans with these antics and refusal to apologize and take ownership of his actions. I think that a lot of us (at least most of us on r/BostonCeltics) are pretty much fed up with it at this point.

Edit: For people unaware of why this meme has caused a reaction, here is the context for what has brought us to this point. 

1.	Kanye West comes under fire for antisemitic comments and for supporting an antisemitic book. West had recently opened up a school, Donda Academy. His Donda Academy sports teams have their games cancelled/banned due to the backlash/negative PR Kanye caused. Jaylen releases an official tweet cutting ties with Donda Sports, Kanye West’s marketing/talent agency he was signed to as a featured athlete. Shortly after this, Jaylen expresses his discontent at the student athletes of Donda Academy having their games cancelled/banned from venues due to the negative PR from Kanye. Donda Academy has since closed down. [(Tweets)](https://imgur.com/a/SqCeJB6) 
2.	Kyrie Irving of the Brooklyn Nets shares an antisemitic documentary on Twitter. The documentary included a mass Jewish conspiracy for world domination. Kanye West calls Kyrie “a real one”. The Brooklyn Nets suspend Kyrie and stipulate that he must fulfill a checklist of items before he can return to play. *The list:  1) Apologize and condemn the movie that he posted on his social media accounts. 2) Make $500,000 worth of donations to anti-hate causes. 3) Take sensitivity training. 4) Take antisemitism training. 5)  Meet with the Anti-Defamation League and Jewish leaders. 6)  Meet with Joe Tsai to demonstrate understanding of why his actions were wrong.* [Jaylen Brown took issue with this.](https://imgur.com/a/vuf8LUU)
3.	Kyrie Irving is set to return to the court to play after (I’m assuming) fulfilling Joe Tsai’s list. Jaylen Brown retweets a video of Black Hebrew Israelites chanting while in formation with the caption “Energy”. [(Tweet)](https://imgur.com/a/imE1dU1)  [(Tweet with video)](https://twitter.com/FCHWPO/status/1594458907883233280?s=20&t=C6-NjMjjyYSu34qEVkvo4Q) This group was outside of Barclay’s arena showing support for Irving and handing out antisemitic propaganda. The Black Hebrew Israelites are a [recognized extremist hate group](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounders/black-hebrew-israelites) by the ADL. 
4.	Jaylen later says he didn’t know what group that was, and confused them with a fraternity. [(Tweets)](https://imgur.com/a/AP8uUtd)   Jaylen then went a step further and said he “didn’t have his reading glasses on” when making the tweet, and that he won’t delete any of the tweets because they’re in support of Kyrie Iriving.

> An LAPD sergeant violated department policy by kneeling on the neck of NBA player Jaxson Hayes while arresting him in response to a call about a domestic dispute last July, the Los Angeles Police Commission ruled Tuesday.
> 
> After Hayes, a 6-foot-11 center for the New Orleans Pelicans, was taken to the ground by police outside a Woodland Hills home, Sgt. Darren Holst began kneeling on his neck.
> 
> Hayes shouted, “I can’t breathe,” and another officer used a Taser on him twice, hitting him once in the chest, LAPD Chief Michel Moore wrote in a report released after the Police Commission’s weekly meeting Tuesday. Commissioners agreed with the chief’s findings that the knee-on-the-neck maneuver went against department protocols but that the use of the Taser was justified.
> 
> In reaching his conclusion, Moore cited a use-of-force review board investigation, which found that Holst twice put his knee on the basketball player’s neck, first for four seconds, and then for 11 seconds. Moore wrote that the sergeant’s tactic “resulted in unintentional but direct pressure to Hayes’ trachea or windpipe” — though not with enough force to render Hayes unconscious.
> 
> Intentional or not, Moore said that he agreed with the board’s finding that “an officer with similar training and experience as Sergeant Holst, in the same situation, would not reasonably believe that the applying direct pressure to the trachea or windpipe was proportional, objectively reasonable, or necessary.”

----

> The officer who deployed the Taser, Frank Duarte, later told investigators that when he heard Hayes shouting for air and noticed Holst kneeling near Hayes’ neck, he asked Holst to get off, according to the report. Hayes then began trying to stand up again, and Duarte fired the Taser into his chest, said the report, quoting Duarte.
> 
> Moore wrote that he agreed with the review board’s finding that Duarte’s use of the Taser was justified, given Hayes’ “level of resistance.” He further said the fact that the officers present weren’t wearing masks as was required at the time of the arrest will be addressed “at the divisional level.”"

I went back through the last 30 drafts (Cade to Shaq) and compared every drafted player's VORP to the VORP of players drafted adjacent to them to calculate for **regret** (picking a dud one slot right before a stud) and for **misfortune** (missing out on a stud by one pick).

# Why should you not continue reading this?

So a number of limitations to cover first before we dive into the numbers.

1. I used VORP because it was convenient not necessarily because it was the best metric. This study is thus as reliable as you think VORP is. How reliable is VORP for this? Just know that Chauncey Billups (43.5) is ranked higher than Giannis (43.3) and decide for yourself.
2. This list is also stupid because it completely ignores sentiment. Per VORP, I should technically regret drafting JRich (23.8) instead of Shane Battier (28.2). While Shane's career was dandy, I promise you will not find any Warrior fan that would trade what we had with JRich. If you do find one, run and do not stop. You have just been conversing with a psychopath.
3. A better example of this is Paul Pierce. Are the Celtics unlucky for missing out on Dirk (84.8) and having to settle for Pierce (65.5) in 98? I think the only Massholes that would affirm that are likewise psychopaths.
4. We're trolling a bit here. Fourteen teams regret passing on Giannis after all, but in this model Utah gets assigned 100% of the regret because they were the very last pick before Giannis.
5. This doesn't account for off-court stuff. IIRC, Kobe fell in 96 because his agent made it clear he would only play for a big market team. Technically, we shouldn't fault Cleveland more than the other 11 teams that passed on him, but we're airing dirty laundry here and a soiled Vitaly Potapenko is too good to not show off.
6. I couldn't keep track of trades, so I used original team slots unless otherwise noted below. It makes for very inconsistent logic and arguments. For example, I have PHI regretting passing on Dirk even though MIL probably would regret trading him even more.
7. As a dumb Californian who thinks everything east of Texas is either New York or Florida, I apologize, I could not fucking keep track of the New Orleans and Charlotte franchises. Picks are tied to the city and not the franchise.
8. Finally, I did this as a passion project late at night when my kids went to sleep. Yes, I'm a fucking loser. Hold the applause. A lot of the work was done after I blazed a bunch of trees like I was a goddamn California wildfire. There are probably errors. Bless you for finding them.

With all that out of the way...

# The Eleven Most Regretful Picks

Regret Index is calculated as the VORP of a player selected minus the VORP of the player selected right after. It's a measure of how much a team's pick outperformed the player picked right after him.

|Pick|Year|Pick|Team|Next Pick|Regret Index|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|12|1996|Vitaly Potapenko|CLE|Kobe Bryant|\-86.0|
|1|2007|Greg Oden|POR|Kevin Durant|\-75.6|
|8|1998|Larry Hughes|PHI|Dirk Nowitzki|\-74.1|
|2|2009|Hasheem Thabeet|MEM|James Harden|\-72.4|
|3|2005|Deron Williams|UTA|Chris Paul|\-65.4|
|6|2009|Jonny Flynn|MIN|Steph Curry|\-62.8|
|1|1994|Glenn Robinson|MIL|Jason Kidd|\-60.0|
|4|1995|Rasheed Wallace|WSB|Kevin Garnett|\-58.6|
|8|1997|Adonal Foyle|GSW|Tracy McGrady|\-54.6|
|3|2008|O.J. Mayo|MIN|Russell Westbrook|\-51.1|
|56|1999|Tim Young|GSW|Manu Ginóbili|\-47.7|

A few notes:

* CLE gets shit on for having the most regretful pick of all time, here but my Warriors actually had the 11th pick that year and we took Todd Fuller who was actually WORSE than Potapenko. I still remember this vividly to this day. Maybe even more so than my own wedding day. Do Cavs fans feel similar pain?
* Oden is a good example of injuries rendering this exercise meaningless. Yes, I suppose POR regrets passing on Durant given what we all know now, but Oden was the consensus #1 pick since birth. Hard to fault them back then. Still gotta live with the regret I guess...
* Who regrets the 98 draft more, PHI for passing on Dirk or MIL for trading him?
* DWill and CP3 were neck and neck for awhile. I'm surprised to see their gap in VORP this large. Testament to CP3's longevity and indictment of DWill's.
* Should MIN's regret index for passing on Steph be multiplied by 2?
* I was there when we picked Adonal Foyle over TMac. Still hurts...
* I didn't know what to do with the Mayo trade. Technically, the trade was after the draft concluded so by the logic of this model, MIN regrets passing on Westbrook. However, they ended up getting Kevin Love, and I doubt there's much regret there at all. MEM on the other hand got the shit end of the stick, so I broke the rules and forced all the regret on their plate.
* I didn't know I regretted passing on Manu until today. So that's why it's a top eleven and not a top ten.

# The Eleven Unluckiest Picks

The misfortune index is calculated as the VORP of the player selected minus the player selected right before him. It's a measure of how much a team's pick outperformed the player picked right before him.

&#x200B;

|Pick|Year|Pick|Team|Prior Pick|Misfortune Index|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|2003|Darko Miličić|DET|LeBron James|\-143.5|
|6|1995|Bryant Reeves|VAN|Kevin Garnett|\-101.2|
|5|2005|Raymond Felton|CHA|Chris Paul|\-83.6|
|2|1997|Keith Van Horn|PHI|Tim Duncan|\-81.5|
|6|2003|Chris Kaman|LAC|Dwyane Wade|\-62.4|
|8|2009|Jordan Hill|NYK|Steph Curry|\-60.9|
|4|2009|Tyreke Evans|SAC|James Harden|\-58.9|
|4|2001|Eddy Curry|CHI|Pau Gasol|\-58.8|
|10|1997|Danny Fortson|MIL|Tracy McGrady|\-58.3|
|11|1998|Bonzi Wells|DET|Paul Pierce|\-57.2|
|6|1998|Robert Traylor|MIL|Vince Carter|\-57.2|

* IIRC, that Piston's pick they used on Darko was top-1 protected, so they had no shot at LeBron anyways. If anything they had extreme fortune in getting a #2 pick the year after they won. So while they technically shouldn't be counted as having the unluckiest pick, they can keep the ignominy because they wasted it on Darko.
* Van Horn was traded to the Nets on draft night, but I'm leaving PHI in this slot to emphasize how close they were to Duncan.
* Technically, it was DAL that barely missed out on Air Canada, but they traded that pick to MIL for Dirk, so Milwaukee gets credited the misfortune. What an all around shitty draft for them that year.
* Not so fun fact: I owned a Danny Fortson jersey at one point in my life. He was the Warrior's best hope once upon a time.

# MOST REGRETFUL TEAMS

Calculating the expected regret per pick for each team over the last 30 years yields the following results. Negative means more regret. I also tried to construct each team's All-Regret team made of the best players picked with the very next pick that each team regrets passing over (per VORP). I had to take significant liberties with positions for some teams.

|Team|Regret/Pick|Backcourt|Backcourt|Frontcourt|Frontcourt|Frontcourt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|UTA|\-2.524|Chris Paul|Gerald Wallace|Giannis Antetokounmpo|Paul George|Josh Smith|

|CLE|\+2.520|Kobe Bryant|Shawn Marion|Draymond Green|Nenê|Jonas Valančiūnas|
|SAS|\+2.996|Isaiah Thomas|Wesley Person|Jimmy Butler|Josh Howard|Larry Nance Jr.|
|NOP|\+4.470|C.J. Miles|Ja Morant|Thabo Sefolosha|James Jones|Meyers Leonard|

* The league average Regret/Pick over the last 30 years is +0.415. That is the increment each pick is expected to outperform the subsequent pick in VORP.
* NOP has drafted with the least regret in the last 30 years with their picks outperforming the next selection by an average of +4.470 in VORP.
* UTA has filled their fans with the most regret, with their picks underperforming the very next pick by 2.524.
* Vince Carter goes to the Warriors All-Regret team despite being drafted by them. That's because the Warriors flipped him to TOR as soon as the pick was made. I can attest. Still very regrettable to this day.
* Ray Allen ends up on MIN's list despite being drafted by them for the same reasons. He was flipped to MIL for Stephon Marbury on draft day.
* SAS could've had Kawhi Leonard and Jimmy Butler in the same draft. They took Cory Joseph one pick ahead of Jimmy Butler. That would've been a wild duo.
* Exactly half the league has been more regretful than league average. That's UTA, LAC, MIL, MEM, PHI, WAS, POR, ATL, CHI, NYK, MIN, SAC, GSW, DET, CHA.
* Some honorable mentions for All-Regret teams. Lamelo Ball (GSW), Jaylen Brown (LAL), DeAndre Jordan (MIN), Devin Booker (UTA)

# UNLUCKIEST TEAMS

Calculating the expected misfortune per pick for each team over the last 30 years yields the following results. Negative means unluckier. All-Misfortune team consists of the best players that outVORPed a team's actual selection with the very next pick.

|DEN|\+2.519|Mike Bibby|Nate Robinson|Antonio Daniels|Matt Bonner|Jim Jackson|
|OKC|\+2.601|Eddie Jones|Goran Dragić|Hedo Türkoğlu|Joe Johnson|Devin Booker|

* The league average for Misfortune/Pick (how much a pick outperforms the player selected right before) is coincidentally -0.415. Well, not coincidence. That's how inverses work. One team's regret is another team's fortune.
* MEM has been the unluckiest, missing out on greatness by one pick more so than any other franchise. In 95 they settled on Big Country after MIN picked KG one pick ahead. That was a -101.2 VORP swing, second largest in the last 30 years. In 09, they picked Hasheem Thabeet right after Blake Griffin, a -32.9 swing. And while the jury's still out on JJJ, missing on Luka by one slot has cost a -17.0 drop in VORP so far.
* OKC has drafted better than the team one pick ahead more often than other teams. Durant after Oden in 07 (+75.6 in VORP), Westbrook after Mayo in 08 (+51.1), and Harden after Thabeet in 09 (+72.4) remains stuff of legends.
* 18 teams are unluckier than league average. They include MEM,LAC, CHA, MIA, NYK, DET, BOS, MIL, NOP, MIN, UTA, ORL, ATL, SAC, CLE, CHI, WAS, PHI.
* Although TOR was unlucky to miss out on Iverson, league rules precluded expansion teams from winning the #1 pick in the lottery for the first 3 years. So technically, they were never that close.
* Charlotte has picked second, thrice after a generational big man went first. They picked Zo after Shaq in 92 (-48.1), Emeka after Dwight in 04 (-32.2), and MKG after AD in 12 (-41.5). Gives me irrational confidence about Wiseman.
* Somehow, Chicago managed to pick right after both Gasol brothers.
* Other honorable mentions: LaMarcus Aldridge (CHA), Yao Ming (CHI), Donovan Mitchell (MIA), Ja Morant (NYK), Julius Randle (SAC), Myles Turner (UTA)

# Other bits and bobs

* Chris Bosh is the top player in no man's land. Carmelo went right before him and has a higher VORP so DEN has no regrets about Bosh. DWade went right after and also has a higher VORP, so MIA does not consider itself unlucky. Does Chris Bosh even really exist? I dunno...
* The next player on this list is Peja Stojaković. Drafted 14th, he was sandwiched in between the selections of Kobe and Steve Nash.
* Al Jefferson is the top player who had the same team regret passing on him that was also so close to getting him. In 04, UTA picked the first Kardashian curse 14th and Kirk Snyder at 16. Al Jefferson outperformed both after being picked 15th.
* I was there for the 2000 draft class. I think everyone regrets making a pick that year.
* DET had consecutive picks in 93. They went with Lindsey Hunter at 10 and Allan Houston at 11. The latter had the better career, so technically the team that regrets passing on Allan Houston is also the team that picked him? It's like when Fry finds out he's his own grandpa!

# Bring the pain!

The Regret Index is a measure of how much each team's front office works through the draft to fuck over their own fanbase. The Misfortune Index is a measure of how much the universe conspires to fuck over a fanbase. Combining the two yields the ultimate in pain. A menage-a-trois of utter disappointment and despair. So which fanbase can claim to be the most fucked over the last 30 years?

And there you have it. UTA comes in third at delivering the most pain to their fans through the NBA draft. If ""name the player selected right before Giannis in 13"" ever comes up in your pub trivia, now you know the answer is Jazz legend Shabazz Muhammad.

MEM comes in second, though I'm guessing most current Grizz fans don't give a shit some Canadian team picked a Big Country over a Big Ticket once upon a time.  Besides, I'm one that believes the Zion-Ja-RJ selections will break most favorably to MEM over the long run.

Finally congratulations Clipbros! You have suffered the most pain in the NBA draft over the last 30 years according to VORP. Just look at the fucking team you can assemble with players either picked directly before or after the Clippers picked. Baron Davis, Dwyane Wade, Gordon Hayward, Pau Gasol, and Amar'e Stoudemire.  Almost merciful you don't have to worry about the draft for the next four years."

Mozgov's ridiculous deal set the market for other marginal big men to get paid, creating a baseline. Dejounte Murray's trade to the Hawks sent two unprotected first-rounders to San Antonio, and Rudy Gobert's trade to Minnesota sent three such picks to the Jazz. The trade equity commanded by those players means that any asking price for Donovan Mitchell or Kevin Durant will be exorbitant to the point that teams will not even consider it.

Question: We haven't heard much from the players around the league about Kyrie Irving's social media posts and subsequent comments. Why do you think that is?

>""I can tell you this, its simple. Me personally, I don't condone any hate to any kind. To any race. To Jewish Communities, to Black communities, to Asian communities. You guys know where I stand. And that's part of the reason why I didn't air The Shop Episode, why we kicked that out of archives. Because it was hate conversation going on there. And I don't represent that. There's no place in the world for it. Nobody can benefit from that and I believe from that and I believe what Kyrie did caused some harm to a lot of people. And he has since, over the last - I think it was today, or yesterday- he apologized. But he caused some harm and I think it's unfortunate. But I don't stand on the position to harm people when it doesn't matter what color your skin is, how tall are you, what position you're in. If you are promoting or soliciting or saying harmful things to any community that harms people, then I don't respect it. I don't condone it.""

Question: What could be a resolution for Irving to get past his current suspensions with the Nets and Nike?

>I don't know. Because at the end of the day, Kyrie is his own man. He stands up in front of the media and speaks. He is a man and from a great family. He's a great.... I love the kid. He's not even a kid anymore, hes 30. I was like, thats insane.  
I dont know the direction, the steps that he takes but he's apologized for what he said and I hope he understands that what he said was harmful to a lot of people. And we as humans, none of us are perfect, but I hope he understands what he did and the actions that he took are just harmful to a lot of people. I really didn't get too much into it too much. But, I understand that when you're hurting anybody, I understand that. That is common sense.

Sure, they were odds-on favorites to win the title before the season started—but when I arrive, in December, the team hasn’t yet clicked into gear. A few weeks from now, on the eve of the All-Star break, things will have changed yet again: the Clippers, for the first time all year, look once more like heavyweights.

10ni0nv,[Analysis] There is a 0.000003% chance that the discrepancy between Jaren Jackson Jr.'s Blocks/Steals is solely due to random distribution,"['Someone explain to me why there’s a picture of the Indian army ?', ""Interesting analysis, but I don't think a Z-test is necessarily the best test to compare these datasets. To my understanding, a Z-Test assumes that you know the population standard deviation and that you have a sample size above n=30. Source: https://vitalflux.com/when-to-use-z-test-vs-t-test-differences-examples/#:~:text=If%20the%20population%20standard%20deviation,%2C%20T%2Dtest%20is%20recommended.\n\nPer the source above, I think a more appropriate test to conduct would be a two-tailed T-test. This is because we are comparing two small sample sets against one another, whereby we do not know the population mean or standard deviation for either set. Link to a copied spreadsheet using a T-test instead: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gAonkgsy7OBfC2fR7E6jMhxErUHhUqSGLzeKba3zex8/edit?usp=sharing\n\nNote that the outcome remains similar. The T-test has a P-value of 0.0019, suggesting that we reject the null hypothesis (that both sample sets have the same mean). But I think this P-value is a bit less sensationalized than the 0.000003% figure that you generated with the Z-test. \n\nI am not a statistician, so I can only comment on the relevant statistical hypothesis test to conduct given my limited experience. The value/relevance of the information I'll leave to someone more capable.\n\nI'll also add a thank you for including your analysis! That is what allows multiple people to review each others' work and come up with thoughtful critiques."", '[deleted]', 'So this supports the original post?', 'Just because scores are normally distributed doesn’t mean blocks and steals are.', 'Take that for data', 'I had stats homework and this helped me understand it thank you lol', '[deleted]', 'Do we expect blocks and steals to be normally distributed?  Seem like a non-distributional test (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney) would be better.', 'There is a 0% chance you understand statistics and probability.']","There is much debate right now about JJJ and the Memphis Grizzlies' scorekeeper boosting his stats. I am not skilled enough in the rulebook to analyze each play individually, but I can look at the numbers to see what the likelihood would be.

Fortunately, we can use a Normal Distribution (or Gaussian Distribution) to do this analysis. [Here is a study showing Normal Distribution in NBA games.](https://priorprobability.com/2014/12/06/nba-data-set/).

A normal distribution lets us analyze the ""bell curve"" of a statistic. Once we know the mean (average) and standard deviation (how spread out it is), we can determine the probability falling in a certain range. As a rule of thumb, 68% of values will fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean, 95% within 2 standard deviations, and 99.7% within 3 standard deviations. [Here is a link with more reading if anyone is curious.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule)

So now onto the analysis. I downloaded the game logs from Basketball Reference, and split them up into home and away. I calculated the Mean and Standard Deviation for his home and road games, and used a Z-Test to compare the two. A Z-Test tells you the probability that a randomly generated sample (of the same size as the data) has a mean value greater than a specified number based on the original data set. Since the number of home and away games is essentially identical, this works out. 

The results of the Z-Test show that there is only a **0.000003%** chance that the difference between his road and home splits is due to random chance. This is 1 in 3 million chance. I am more likely to get struck by lightning than JJJ to have gotten these stats due to random  chance.

**Important:**

It’s important to note that statistically significant doesn’t describe the cause behind it. It could be he’s playing much better at home, or he’s getting better scorekeeping. All it says is that “something is different here”

To repeat: **I am not testing why there is a difference. Just noting that there is one.**

Edit: another test you can do is a T-Test, which might be more suited based on the sample size. u/InOrbit3532 found the results [here](https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/10ni0nv/_/j694k3w/?context=1) with a 0.19% chance.

Edit: for those saying that you can’t do this analysis because home and road splits are different- [see this comment](https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/10ni0nv/_/j68v8gb/?context=1) from u/Fofodrip . The difference is 4.8 vs 4.7 blocks per game. It’s totally possible JJJ just plays better at home but thats not really the norm.

Five years ago, Pandya estimates that he alone would see about 1,500 pediatric sports injuries and perform maybe 150 surgeries -- ACL, cartilage, shoulder injuries -- in a single year; those numbers have ""skyrocketed,"" he says, and last year stood at 6,000 and 400, respectively.

> The current ""load management"" debate is simply not rooted in science or medicine. A major factor: Many players now enter the NBA with badly broken bodies. I reported on this massive crisis over a two-year period.

> This was not always the case. Decades ago, players didn't specialize. They played multiple sports. They took summers off. They had ""normal"" childhoods. Now, kids begin playing as young as 8 years old, and they play all year from then on. That mileage adds up -- in an awful way.

> This whole movement involves millions of kids. It's taxing on orthopedic surgeons, some of whom now repair torn ACLs and Achilles ruptures on children under 10 years old. The NBA is tough enough on the body. An already broken body? It's so much worse.

> Simply saying that one era was ""tougher"" than the current era is shortsighted. So much has changed. Just ask team doctors and athletic trainers. Ask NBA GMs. Ask youth coaches and orthopedic surgeons. This discussion must evolve for the better.

> This is from part one of my two-part series, based on dozens of interviews w/ NBA team and league officials, current and former players, AAU coaches, parents, youth players, researchers and medical and athletic training officials in & around the NBA. It's the heart of the issue"

As the Center of the Suns, he would have a temperature of approximately [27 million degrees farenheit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_core) This is incredibly hot, as most people would die at this temperature.

The only other incredibly hot players I can think of might be Eric Gordon or Jae'Sean Tate. According to sources, Rockets Wings can reach up to [3,000 degrees farenheit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_thermal_protection_system) upon reentry.

Now I know what you're thinking; ""What about OKC, they must have some hot players, being Thunder and all?"" Lightnight does have a core temperature of [50,000 degrees farenheit](https://www.seeker.com/is-lightning-hotter-than-the-sun-1765058578.html), but Thunder is a sound. No temperature in sound. Sorry Dort. And ""Heat"" is more of a concept, and I don't know how we would measure how hot a Heat player technically is. Going off their flaming-basketball logo, we would go with the temperature leather burns at, which is around [450 degrees farenheit](https://www.tcforensic.com.au/docs/article10.html).

Los Angeles Lakers guard Russell Westbrook is set to hand out 400 pairs of shoes to students at Westbrook Academy, also known as the Russell Westbrook Why Not? Academy, in South Los Angeles in the spirit of the holiday season.

While he’s handing out shoes, students will see their campus transform into a ""Winter Wonderland,"" which will feature a Christmas-themed photo booth, chocolate stations, and more. The charter school is located in South LA’s Vermont Square neighborhood.

Earlier this year, Westbrook, his wife Nina, and business partner Donnell Beverly joined forces with the LA Promise Fund to launch the academy. They aim to give students in the under-resourced community access to a strong education, leadership development, and access to high-quality athletic programs. 

""Creating and supporting educational opportunities for underserved youth has always been a passion of mine. It’s so important that every child has access to a good education regardless of their socioeconomic background. My goal in partnering with the LA Promise Fund is to ensure our South LA students are ready for college and ultimately success in a 21st-century career,"" Westbrook said in a press release.

Westbrook is a nine-time NBA All-Star, a member of the NBA 75th Anniversary team, **and was named the league MVP** in the 2016-17 season when he played for the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Joe Mazzulla seems to have a quizlet account which has notes on NBA teams and their players, including information on how they prefer to attack and any weaknesses. He did this up until April 2021. He was hired as an assistant coach by the Celtics in 2019, so he did this while on staff.

Really interesting account. [Here's the account.](https://quizlet.com/Joseph_Mazzulla)

A lot of ""higher pace"" and ""higher offensive rating"" across the league is also a product of just a lot more free throws. So you have higher ""pace"" (because you have more possessions) but the game is less fluid.

It's a combination of course - As more ticky-tack shit gets called a foul, so do defenders sag off more and basically play no defense on drives and jumpshots because they rather concede the basket than get an almost guarenteed and-1.

I think it’s fair criticism when you remember his mom called Ja to intimidate a Finish Line employee. She knows her son can get away with things most others can’t and used that to her advantage, so it’s not a stretch to wonder if the dad thinks the same way.

>Superstar NBA guard James Harden and the Philadelphia 76ers are still ironing out the final details of a one-plus-one contract that will see him take a $15 million discount. But Harden said he is “locked in” with the Sixers and eager to get to work.

>”I had conversations with Daryl, and it was explained how we could get better and what the market value was for certain players. I told Daryl to improve the roster, sign who we needed to sign and give me whatever is left over,” Harden told Yahoo Sports. “This is how bad I want to win. I want to compete for a championship. That’s all that matters to me at this stage. I’m willing to take less to put us in position to accomplish that.”

>”I think we have a much deeper team,” Harden told Yahoo Sports. “That’s something we wanted to address. If you look at our team now, we’re positioned to go a lot further. I like how we stack up with the rest of the top teams.”

On the criticism he receives:

>”I don’t really listen to what people are saying. I wasn’t right last season and I still almost averaged a triple-double,” Harden told Yahoo Sports. “If anybody else had those numbers, we’d be talking about them getting the max. People were used to seeing me averaging 40, 30 points, and so they viewed it as a down year. I was in Philadelphia for a couple of months and I had to learn on the fly. That’s just what it was. I’m in a good space physically and mentally right now, and I’m just looking forward to next season.”

On his partnership with Joel Embiid:

>”I talk with Joel frequently and we have meetings about how we’re going to play and what we need to do to help our team win a championship,” Harden told Yahoo Sports. “When you have two of the top players at their positions on the same team, that’s a great building block. We’re going to grow together and try to lead this team to the top. I believe we can do it together.”"

(In the old days, they used that ball now and then for smaller decisions, including breaking ties in draft order, officials have said.)

He recalled the one time he showed up to a Lakers practice as a rookie smelling like alcohol, and how Kobe ruthlessly went at him.

>*“I remember one time my rookie year, I came in a little, uh him (Kobe Bryant) and Shaq like to do this as, I think it was just rookies, but any young guy, I probably had too much to drink the night before, so I came in, I was a rookie, I felt good, and they could smell some alcohol on me. And Kobe informed the rest of the team that no one was allowed to help me on defense, and that I had to guard him the entire practice.*  
>  
>*“I was laughing at first like, ‘Oh, this is funny,’ but in Kobe’s mind, in his eyes, it was like, ‘No, I see and smell weakness, I’m going to destroy you today.’ He taught me that lesson. He probably scored 70-something in practice that day, and I was begging for help, none of the teammates would help. But yeah, his killer instinct and his work ethic, they’ll stick with me forever.”*

 Then, Walton added that Shaq did the exact same thing to him. 

> *“Shaq did it to me too one day. Yeah, Shaq made me guard him, and then I just started trying to foul him, and he told me that if I kept fouling him, he was gonna punch me, so then I stopped fouling him. It wasn’t fair. I felt like I was a child trying to play a grown man’s game.”*"

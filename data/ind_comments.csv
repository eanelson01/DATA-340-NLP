What I said was just hurtful.""","> Fifteen years later, Tim Hardaway’s words still reverberate in the world around him. They shadow him, torment him, stubbornly refuse to disappear.    > *I hate gay people … I don’t like to be around them … I am homophobic.*    > Until now, Hardaway seldom explained why he felt that way 15 years ago and how the fallout hasn’t faded. This month, in an extended phone interview with The Chronicle, Hardaway elaborated on the roots of his previous views and how those long-ago remarks affect his life today.    > “I grew up in a church, and that’s the way churches were — they instilled in you that (homosexuality) wasn’t the way you should be,” he said. “I was just taught differently. Don’t talk to them, don’t mess with them, leave them alone.    > “I never tried to talk bad about them or do hateful stuff. It was just my upbringing in church. But I’ll tell you this: It was so wrong of me, and people have suffered. I had to grow up and really do some soul-searching. What I said was just hurtful.”    > Hardaway backtracked slightly later in the interview, saying he doesn’t blame the church and “it’s on me, too.” But he was more forceful about the impact his comments have had on his post-NBA playing career.    > “A lot of people don’t want to deal with me because I said that, and I’m not getting a second chance,” Hardaway told The Chronicle. “I understand…but it does bother me. A lot of people are still holding it over me. Some organizations don’t want to talk to me. I keep moving and walk past them just like they walk past me. I’m a realist. My parents always said turn a wrong into a right, so you do what you can to show people you’re not that type of person.”    > Beyond his interactions with potential employers, Hardaway sometimes cannot escape his past when he walks out in public. He feels the stares and hears the whispers, and he’s convinced they’re not simply because he was a five-time NBA All-Star.    > “I know when people are looking at me crazy,” Hardaway said, “they’re thinking, ‘That’s the guy who said that about gay people.’ ”    > He was nearly four years removed from his final NBA game when he went on then-Miami Herald columnist Dan Le Batard’s radio show on Feb. 14, 2007. Hardaway spent five-plus seasons playing for the Heat (1996-2001) after starting his career with the Warriors. John Amaechi, a retired NBA center, had just published a memoir in which he revealed he was gay. So Le Batard asked Hardaway how he would “deal with a gay teammate,” and he said he wouldn’t want such a player on his team.    > “Well, you know, I hate gay people, so I let it be known,” Hardaway told Le Batard. “I don’t like gay people and I don’t like to be around gay people. I am homophobic. I don’t like it.

y8klxp,"Ben Simmons' fouled out in first official game as a Nets. He had 4 pts on 2/3 shooting, 0/2 FTs, 5 rebs, 5 asts, 6 fouls in 23 minutes.","At his core, Ben Simmons is a guy who doesn't want to do anything he's not already good at.    When he came into the league his potential was enormous - he had huge wingspan, great defensive instincts, natural court vision and passing skill, the strength to finish at the rim, and more. Sure he needed to work on his shot, along with other refinements, but that would come in time.    Except it didn't, because instead of trying to shore up his weaknesses and become a complete basketball player, Ben decided he didn't need to develop new skills and instead hyper-focused on what he could already do well. Rather than put in the work to turn his weaknesses into strengths, he just stopped doing anything that would put him in an uncomfortable position on the court. Most famously his shooting atrophied into nothing, but other elements of his play fell into the same pattern, like his half-court passing.    And once opposing teams saw how he was limiting himself, it cascaded. Rather than freeing him to do a smaller set of things near-perfectly, this approach made him easy to shut down. And when Ben got shut down, he  adjusted by shrinking his game even more, trying to rely on whatever was still working while abandoning the rest, until he was taking himself out of the offense entirely. The Atlanta series and its aftermath was the most striking display of that tendency, but it had been playing out for almost his entire career.     And now, at the ripe old age of 26, the list of things he won't try because he's afraid of failing is almost the entire NBA rulebook, leaving damn near nothing he's actually willing to *do* against competent opponents. It's a waste of what could have been generational talent, but he's got no one to blame but himself.","['core', 'ben', 'simmons', 'guy', 'want', 'anything', 'already', 'good', '   ', 'come', 'league', 'potential', 'enormous', 'huge', 'wingspan', 'great', 'defensive', 'instinct', 'natural', 'court', 'vision', 'pass', 'skill', 'strength', 'finish', 'rim', 'sure', 'work', 'shot', 'along', 'refinement', 'come', 'time', '   ', 'except', 'instead', 'try', 'shore', 'weakness', 'become', 'complete', 'basketball', 'player', 'ben', 'decide', 'develop', 'new', 'skill', 'instead', 'hyper', 'focused', 'already', 'well', 'rather', 'put', 'work', 'turn', 'weakness', 'strength', 'stop', 'anything', 'put', 'uncomfortable', 'position', 'court', 'famously', 'shooting', 'atrophy', 'nothing', 'element', 'play', 'fall', 'pattern', 'like', 'half', 'court', 'passing', '   ', 'oppose', 'team', 'see', 'limit', 'cascade', 'rather', 'free', 'small', 'set', 'thing', 'near', 'perfectly', 'approach', 'make', 'easy', 'shut', 'ben', 'got', 'shut', 'adjust', 'shrink', 'game', 'even', 'try', 'rely', 'whatever', 'still', 'work', 'abandon', 'rest', 'take', 'offense', 'entirely', 'atlanta', 'series', 'aftermath', 'striking', 'display', 'tendency', 'play', 'almost', 'entire', 'career', '    ', 'ripe', 'old', 'age', '26', 'list', 'thing', 'try', 'afraid', 'fail', 'almost', 'entire', 'nba', 'rulebook', 'leave', 'damn', 'near', 'nothing', 'actually', 'willing', 'competent', 'opponent', 'waste', 'generational', 'talent', 'get', 'one', 'blame']","['Ben Simmons', 'Ben', 'Ben', 'Atlanta', 'NBA']",NEGATIVE

11fdppj,"[Buckner] Exclusive: Ja Morant has been accused of two additional disturbing encounters (besides the Pacers' team bus incident), which includes allegedly beating up a 17-year-old boy and pointing a gun at him.","Mall incident mentioned in the article is new:    > A call from the mall  Morant is known for highflying dunks, a thirst for trash talk and a tightknit relationship with his father, Tee, who sits courtside at many games. His family has become so much a part of Morant’s brand that Tee Morant narrated the commercial launching his son’s latest major brand deal, with Powerade.    >Ja Morant was one of the stars of last year’s playoffs before the Grizzlies lost a heated series with the eventual-champion Golden State Warriors.  Two months after the loss to Golden State, Morant’s mother was at a Finish Line shoe store at a Memphis mall when she got in a dispute with a store employee, according to a Memphis Police report obtained by The Post. She called Morant, who arrived shortly after with a group of as many as nine other people.    >Confronted by the director of mall security, Morant and his friends refused the security guard’s demands to leave the mall parking lot. Police arrived and a “verbal confrontation” escalated, the report says, until someone in the group allegedly pushed the security director in the head.    >“As the group was leaving the premises … Ja Morant said, ‘Let me find out what time he gets off,’ ” police wrote in the report.    >The guard wanted to file a report, police wrote, “because he felt threatened by the statement from Ja Morant” and had been assaulted by the person who had pushed him. The “disturbing parties left the scene,” and no arrests were made.    > The Grizzlies, NBA and Morant’s agent did not respond to questions about the incident. The security guard declined to comment.    -    Also his best friend Pack seems to be a common denominator (and the punched boy's mom doesn't seem to have a good rep in the legal system):    > In an interview with police, a transcript shows, one of Morant’s attorneys, who did not respond to a request for comment from The Post, said the boy’s mother had demanded millions of dollars from Morant after the incident. “The first thing we got was a 20 million dollar demand. This is a shake down,” he said. The boy’s mother has a history of filing lawsuits that have eventually been dismissed, court records show, including a discrimination lawsuit against the city’s fire department and a lawsuit against her children’s school district after she said they were bullied on a school bus.        > The police report does not name Morant’s “best friend,” who the boy said had punched him on the other side of the jaw. But a person familiar with the lawsuit, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because it was under seal, said the friend was Pack, a childhood friend of Morant’s who is also named in the family’s lawsuit. Pack could not be reached for comment.    > Pack shouted expletives at Pacers players, the Athletic reported, until an official intervened and Pack was escorted off the floor. Later that night, the Athletic reported, the altercation continued outside the arena, where members of Morant’s entourage confronted members of the Pacers near the team’s bus. After Morant got into an SUV, a red laser was trained at members of the team from inside the car, the Athletic reported, prompting a member of the Pacers’ security team to say, “That’s 100 percent a gun.”","['mall', 'incident', 'mention', 'article', 'new', '   ', 'call', 'mall', 'morant', 'know', 'highflye', 'dunk', 'thirst', 'trash', 'talk', 'tightknit', 'relationship', 'father', 'tee', 'sit', 'courtside', 'many', 'game', 'family', 'become', 'much', 'part', 'morant', '’s', 'brand', 'tee', 'morant', 'narrate', 'commercial', 'launch', 'son', '’s', 'late', 'major', 'brand', 'deal', 'powerade', '   ', 'ja', 'morant', 'one', 'star', 'last', 'year', '’s', 'playoff', 'grizzlies', 'lose', 'heated', 'series', 'eventual', 'champion', 'golden', 'state', 'warrior', 'two', 'month', 'loss', 'golden', 'state', 'morant', '’s', 'mother', 'finish', 'line', 'shoe', 'store', 'memphis', 'mall', 'get', 'dispute', 'store', 'employee', 'accord', 'memphis', 'police', 'report', 'obtain', 'post', 'call', 'morant', 'arrive', 'shortly', 'group', 'many', 'nine', 'people', '   ', 'confront', 'director', 'mall', 'security', 'morant', 'friend', 'refuse', 'security', 'guard', '’s', 'demand', 'leave', 'mall', 'parking', 'lot', 'police', 'arrive', 'verbal', 'confrontation', 'escalate', 'report', 'say', 'someone', 'group', 'allegedly', 'push', 'security', 'director', 'head', '   ', 'group', 'leave', 'premise', '…', 'ja', 'morant', 'say', 'let', 'find', 'time', 'get', 'police', 'write', 'report', '   ', 'guard', 'want', 'file', 'report', 'police', 'write', 'felt', 'threaten', 'statement', 'ja', 'morant', 'assault', 'person', 'push', 'disturbing', 'party', 'leave', 'scene', 'arrest', 'make', '   ', 'grizzlies', 'nba', 'morant', '’s', 'agent', 'respond', 'question', 'incident', 'security', 'guard', 'decline', 'comment', '   ', '   ', 'also', 'good', 'friend', 'pack', 'seem', 'common', 'denominator', 'punched', 'boy', 'mom', 'seem', 'good', 'rep', 'legal', 'system', '):', '   ', 'interview', 'police', 'transcript', 'show', 'one', 'morant', '’s', 'attorney', 'respond', 'request', 'comment', 'post', 'say', 'boy', '’s', 'mother', 'demand', 'million', 'dollar', 'morant', 'incident', 'first', 'thing', 'get', '20', 'million', 'dollar', 'demand', 'shake', 'say', 'boy', '’s', 'mother', 'history', 'filing', 'lawsuit', 'eventually', 'dismiss', 'court', 'record', 'show', 'include', 'discrimination', 'lawsuit', 'city', '’s', 'fire', 'department', 'lawsuit', 'child', '’s', 'school', 'district', 'say', 'bully', 'school', 'bus', '       ', 'police', 'report', 'name', 'morant', '’s', 'good', 'friend', 'boy', 'say', 'punch', 'side', 'jaw', 'person', 'familiar', 'lawsuit', 'speak', 'condition', 'anonymity', 'seal', 'say', 'friend', 'pack', 'childhood', 'friend', 'morant', '’s', 'also', 'name', 'family', '’s', 'lawsuit', 'pack', 'reach', 'comment', '   ', 'pack', 'shout', 'expletive', 'pacers', 'player', 'athletic', 'report', 'official', 'intervene', 'pack', 'escort', 'floor', 'later', 'night', 'athletic', 'report', 'altercation', 'continue', 'outside', 'arena', 'member', 'morant', '’s', 'entourage', 'confront', 'member', 'pacers', 'near', 'team', '’s', 'bus', 'morant', 'get', 'suv', 'red', 'laser', 'train', 'member', 'team', 'inside', 'car', 'athletic', 'report', 'prompt', 'member', 'pacers', '’', 'security', 'team', 'say', '’', '100', 'percent', 'gun']","['Morant', 'Tee', 'Moran', '##t', 'Tee Morant', 'Powerade', 'Ja Morant', 'Grizzlies', 'Golden State Warriors', 'Golden State', 'Morant', 'Finish Line', 'Memphis', 'Memphis Police', 'The Post', 'Morant', 'Morant', 'Ja Morant', 'Ja Morant', 'Grizzlies', 'NBA', 'Morant', 'Pack', 'Moran', 'Post', 'Moran']",

vtil6w,[Windhorst] The Nets thought there would be a bidding war for Kevin Durant. They were wrong.,"He's too high risk, even if he was the best player in the NBA.    1. His performance hasn't deteriorated since his injury, but his health has. He has practically only played 50% of his regular season games since his injury. This could easily worsen since he will be 34 when the season starts.  2. There is no guarantee he won't force an out again.  3. The cost of acquiring him completely depletes the team of all quality players. The Nets have shown that a team with Durant and an all-star will still get swept in the playoffs.  4. The team needs to be prepared the same way Toronto was when they got Leonard, which is to field a team that can be in the playoffs even without Durant. No team can trade for Durant and still field a team that can do that.    Ultimately, Durant's massive contract actually works against him and the Nets.

v4o3ly,It is absolutely ridiculous that there is no Saturday Finals game this year.,"The Finals haven’t been on a Saturday for more than 20 years.     When ABC took over in 2003, they did Thursday, Sunday, Tuesday.    In 2014 they switched to 2-2-1-1-1 and in 2016 they added the extra rest days between games 4-7.    Saturdays have historically been terrible for ratings. It’s the least watched day for TV. NBC begged the NHL to not have them start the Stanley Cup Finals on Saturday because ratings were so terrible. The extra day between Games 1-2 for the NBA Finals makes it super obvious they’re avoiding Saturday.     TL;DR: No one watches TV on a Saturday. So they put it on Sunday to maximize ratings.    I do agree that they can put it earlier on Sunday though. Maybe a 7:30 pm tip instead of 8 so the fourth quarter can begin before 10 lol    EDIT: Yes, Game 5 was on a Saturday last year. An anomaly for the past 30ish (40ish?) years because of COVID. Compared to the other games in the series, it did modestly well. Third-best rated game in the series. Couple of reasons: As the series goes longer, ratings usually rise. A Saturday game late in the series is more justifiable than an early game (e.g., a game 2).     For those of us who remember: in the late 90s and early 2000s, the World Series started on a Saturday. It went: Sat-Sun-T-W-Th-S-Su.     Wonder why it changed? Ratings.

As a consequence people who dislike basketball truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Kevin's existencial catchphrase ""Lets take it to Twitter,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Burners and Alts.

I first and foremost want to give my deepest thanks to all of you who garnered the courage to share your experiences, as difficult as it may have been, to help piece together a clearer picture of what work life must have been like for you over these past 18 years.    >There should be zero tolerance for discriminatory actions of any level, in any setting, let alone a professional one. There is no question that the findings determined that Mr. Sarver’s lewd, misogynist, and racist conduct had a substantial negative impact on you and has no place in our society. The report confirmed by multiple eyewitnesses that Robert Sarver used the “N-word” at least five times. The report confirmed Sarver engaged in conduct demeaning of female and pregnant employees. The report confirmed Sarver made crude and sexually inappropriate comments in professional settings. The report confirmed Sarver made inappropriate comments about the physical appearance of female employees and other women and made inappropriate workplace physical conduct toward male employees.    >WORDS AND ACTIONS MATTER.    >Similar conduct by any CEO, executive director, president, teacher, coach, or any other position of leadership would warrant immediate termination. The fact that Robert Sarver “owns” the team does not give him a license to treat others differently than any other leader. The fact that anyone would find him fit to lead because of this “ownership” position is forgetting that NBA teams belong to the communities they serve. Team investors are merely temporary stewards. If we, as sports leaders, are not held to the same standards then how can we expect a functional society with integrity and respect on any level? We owe it to you: employees, players, partners, and your families to provide the same positive workplace environment we would require of any other business.    >I cannot in good judgment sit back and allow our children and future generations of fans to think that this behavior is tolerated because of wealth and privilege. Therefore, in accordance with my commitment to helping eradicate any form of racism, sexism and bias, as Vice Chairman of the Phoenix Suns, I am calling for the resignation of Robert Sarver. While I have no interest in becoming the managing partner, I will work tirelessly to ensure the next team steward treats all stakeholders with dignity, professionalism and respect.","['full', 'statement', '   ', 'due', 'nba', '’s', 'investigation', 'finding', 'choice', 'speak', 'behalf', 'hundred', 'impact', 'interaction', 'robert', 'sarver', 'result', 'investigation', 'conduct', 'first', 'foremost', 'want', 'give', 'deep', 'thank', 'garner', 'courage', 'share', 'experience', 'difficult', 'may', 'help', 'piece', 'together', 'clear', 'picture', 'work', 'life', 'like', 'past', '18', 'year', '   ', 'zero', 'tolerance', 'discriminatory', 'action', 'level', 'setting', 'let', 'alone', 'professional', 'one', 'question', 'finding', 'determine', 'mr.', 'sarver', '’s', 'lewd', 'misogynist', 'racist', 'conduct', 'substantial', 'negative', 'impact', 'place', 'society', 'report', 'confirm', 'multiple', 'eyewitness', 'robert', 'sarver', 'word', 'least', 'five', 'time', 'report', 'confirm', 'sarver', 'engage', 'conduct', 'demeaning', 'female', 'pregnant', 'employee', 'report', 'confirm', 'sarver', 'make', 'crude', 'sexually', 'inappropriate', 'comment', 'professional', 'setting', 'report', 'confirm', 'sarver', 'make', 'inappropriate', 'comment', 'physical', 'appearance', 'female', 'employee', 'woman', 'make', 'inappropriate', 'workplace', 'physical', 'conduct', 'toward', 'male', 'employee', '   ', 'words', 'actions', 'matter', '   ', 'similar', 'conduct', 'ceo', 'executive', 'director', 'president', 'teacher', 'coach', 'position', 'leadership', 'warrant', 'immediate', 'termination', 'fact', 'robert', 'sarver', 'team', 'give', 'license', 'treat', 'differently', 'leader', 'fact', 'anyone', 'find', 'fit', 'lead', 'ownership', 'position', 'forget', 'nba', 'team', 'belong', 'community', 'serve', 'team', 'investor', 'merely', 'temporary', 'steward', 'sport', 'leader', 'hold', 'standard', 'expect', 'functional', 'society', 'integrity', 'respect', 'level', 'owe', 'employee', 'player', 'partner', 'family', 'provide', 'positive', 'workplace', 'environment', 'require', 'business', '   ', 'good', 'judgment', 'sit', 'back', 'allow', 'child', 'future', 'generation', 'fan', 'think', 'behavior', 'tolerate', 'wealth', 'privilege', 'therefore', 'accordance', 'commitment', 'helping', 'eradicate', 'form', 'racism', 'sexism', 'bias', 'vice', 'chairman', 'phoenix', 'suns', 'call', 'resignation', 'robert', 'sarver', 'interest', 'become', 'manage', 'partner', 'work', 'tirelessly', 'ensure', 'next', 'team', 'steward', 'treat', 'stakeholder', 'dignity', 'professionalism', 'respect']","['NBA', 'Robert Sarver', 'Sarver', 'Robert Sarver', 'N', 'Sarver', 'Sarver', 'Sarver', 'Robert Sarver', 'NBA', 'Phoenix Suns', 'Robert Sarve']",

vx8dsq,5 reasons why 1996 Bulls will not win a single game in today's NBA,"It's not that you're wrong, exactly, it's just that this is completely irrelevant. This is just classic r/nba nephew shit. People drink a glass of milk or read a blog post and suddenly they are an expert on livestock.    According to the most recent CBA, **U.S. players must be at least one year removed from high school and 19 years of age (by the end of that calendar year) before entering the draft.**    Bulls, much like cows, may generally live ten to twelve years. Most bulls will remain active in the herd for closer to four or five years due to feet and leg, structural, and fertility problems, temperament concerns, or injuries. Though they can live to 18-20, this is far from the norm.    Out of the 1996 Bulls, I grant you that most will successfully graduate high school if shepherded through the proper modern-day AAU program. However, according to Official Guinness Records, the oldest bull ever to have participated in an athletic competition was Red Wolf from Herrington Cattle Company who bucked until the 2000 World Rodeo Finals and was **13 years old.**    Yet you would stage a basketball game that involves *nearly 2000 morbidly geriatric animals.* Animals with bad feet, bad legs, bent backs, limp dicks, and shitty attitudes. And you are talking about docility?? What the everliving fuck is a 700 kg sack of potatoes that can't even get off the truck without a hydraulic lift going to do on a basketball court?

That's why a strong team ownership and a competent front office matters.   Why drafting well, smart free agency moves and player development matters.  Putting the weight of making marginal or role players better on the backs of the superstars is a cop out that takes the responsibility off the coach and front office.   If Luka makes a great pass that Tim Hardaway turns over, eventually he'll get frustrated and want to either go to another team to squad up with other superstars or entice other stars to Dallas....and people will vilify him for it.   Tying a player's legacy to championships make them want to do that or else they'll have it hanging over their heads forever, which isn't fair.

Some things are more important though, as Pop always says, for which this serves as a reminder.  I just wish the Spurs' decisive move here wasn't such an abnormality among professional teams.

It doesn't at all explain the shit he's going through now.    Simmons was very good in his 4 years in Philly: 3 All Star appearance, an All NBA team, averaging 15/8/8 on above average TS%. He never took jump shots, but he delivered consistent rim pressure and was always top 5 in the league in shots at the rim. Fans were obviously disappointed that he never improved from his rookie year given his lofty prospect hype, but he was still an All Star level player.    This year, he's averaging just 7 PPG and has stopped attacking the rim.

Charge right into the lane. Smash into the best offensive player on D while going for the ball, come what may. Limited offensive moves. So make no mistake about it. Embiid knows what he's doing. He knows people will be injured. He knows his skillset is limited and this is how he can win. He knows people will give way when he drives, think twice on their drives, etc. He will only be stopped by a stronger player and/or fearless players like Giannis, Gasol, Draymond, etc. Or by an obviously more skilled player with equal Type A like Ibaka. He didn't intend to injure, but he certainly intends to show you that he doesn't care if you get hurt when he rumbles into you. At least that's how I used to play. But that was streetball. Eventually I got more moves, played w better players, played real basketball w refs.

Arrangements for his memorial service will be announced soon.    >    >Bill's two state championships in high school offered a glimmer of the incomparable run of pure team accomplishment to come: twice an NCAA champion; captain of a gold-medal-winning US Olympic team; 11 times an NBA champion; and at the helm for two NBA championships as the first black head coach of any North American professional sports team.    >    >Along the way, Bill earned a string of individual awards that stands unprecedented as it went unmentioned by him. In 2009 the award for the NBA Finals most valuable player was renamed after two-time Hall of Famer as the ""Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award""...    >    >...But for all the winning, Bill's understanding of the struggle is what illuminated his life. From boycotting a 1961 exhibition game to unmask too-long-tolerated discrimination, to leading Mississippi's first integrated basketball camp in the combustible wake of Medgar Evans' [sic] assassination, to decades of activism ultimately recognized by his receipt of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2010, Bill called out injustice with an unforgiving candor that he intended would disrupt the status quo, and with a powerful example that, though never his humble intention, will forever inspire teamwork, selflessness, and thoughtful change.     >    >Bill's wife, Jeannine, and his many friends and family thank you for keeping Bill in your prayers. Perhaps you'll relive one or two of the golden moments he gave us, or recall his trademark laugh as he delighted in explaining the real story behind how those moments unfolded. And we hope each of us can find a new way to act of speak with Bill's uncompromising, dignified, and always constructive commitment to principle.

To my understanding, a Z-Test assumes that you know the population standard deviation and that you have a sample size above n=30. Source: https://vitalflux.com/when-to-use-z-test-vs-t-test-differences-examples/#:~:text=If%20the%20population%20standard%20deviation,%2C%20T%2Dtest%20is%20recommended.    Per the source above, I think a more appropriate test to conduct would be a two-tailed T-test. This is because we are comparing two small sample sets against one another, whereby we do not know the population mean or standard deviation for either set. Link to a copied spreadsheet using a T-test instead: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gAonkgsy7OBfC2fR7E6jMhxErUHhUqSGLzeKba3zex8/edit?usp=sharing    Note that the outcome remains similar. The T-test has a P-value of 0.0019, suggesting that we reject the null hypothesis (that both sample sets have the same mean). But I think this P-value is a bit less sensationalized than the 0.000003% figure that you generated with the Z-test.     I am not a statistician, so I can only comment on the relevant statistical hypothesis test to conduct given my limited experience. The value/relevance of the information I'll leave to someone more capable.    I'll also add a thank you for including your analysis!

But, in time, it became so commonplace that soon the shock wore off -- no longer did an ACL surgery to an 8-year-old raise eyebrows, nor did the constant stream of patients so young seem unusual. Five years ago, Pandya estimates that he alone would see about 1,500 pediatric sports injuries and perform maybe 150 surgeries -- ACL, cartilage, shoulder injuries -- in a single year; those numbers have ""skyrocketed,"" he says, and last year stood at 6,000 and 400, respectively.

I’m looking at [Spurs executive] R.C. [Buford], you started this all.”","It's a conundrum. If the season is so long that healthy players literally cannot make it through the season without skipping scheduled games at the last second, then that's a problem.     But on the other hand, it seems like in-game minutes are managed better than they were in previous eras (top 10 MPG in the 90's were generally all 40 or higher, whereas no one hit 38 this year) and playing all games so long as you're healthy has been viable for pretty much the entire history of the league before this era (of course, there's other contributing factors to account for but for the sake of brevity I'll leave those be for now).    Either way, paying for a basketball game these days is a *big* ask for a lot of people. I'm not poor, but I'm certainly not rich, and sitting in the upper deck for a random regular season Pistons game is usually a $100+ excursion once I account for tickets, parking, modest refreshments, gas, etc. I can't make that call to go see a game very often.     So if I circle a date on a calendar to make it my one game of the year (let's say Cade vs. LeBron), only to find out on gameday that both Cade and LeBron have decided to make themselves healthy scratches... I can't vibe with that as a consumer of product.     If the NBA wants to institute a refund or future discount policy for these moments, then you're probably making headway (if LBJ sits after you've bought a ticket, you get a free ticket to a future game). Otherwise, I find it to be a problematic business model. It's like buying tickets to see Top Gun: Maverick but the theater decides to edit out Tom Cruise once you're in your seats.","['conundrum', 'season', 'long', 'healthy', 'player', 'literally', 'make', 'season', 'without', 'skip', 'schedule', 'game', 'last', 'second', 'problem', '    ', 'hand', 'seem', 'like', 'game', 'minute', 'manage', 'well', 'previous', 'era', 'top', '10', 'mpg', '90', 'generally', '40', 'high', 'whereas', 'one', 'hit', '38', 'year', 'play', 'game', 'long', 'healthy', 'viable', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'history', 'league', 'era', 'course', 'contribute', 'factor', 'account', 'sake', 'brevity', 'leave', '   ', 'either', 'way', 'pay', 'basketball', 'game', 'day', 'big', 'ask', 'lot', 'people', 'poor', 'certainly', 'rich', 'sit', 'upper', 'deck', 'random', 'regular', 'season', 'piston', 'game', 'usually', '100', 'excursion', 'account', 'ticket', 'parking', 'modest', 'refreshment', 'gas', 'etc', 'make', 'call', 'go', 'see', 'game', 'often', '    ', 'circle', 'date', 'calendar', 'make', 'one', 'game', 'year', 'let', 'say', 'cade', 'vs.', 'lebron', 'find', 'gameday', 'cade', 'lebron', 'decide', 'make', 'healthy', 'scratch', '...', 'vibe', 'consumer', 'product', '    ', 'nba', 'want', 'institute', 'refund', 'future', 'discount', 'policy', 'moment', 'probably', 'make', 'headway', 'lbj', 'sit', 'buy', 'ticket', 'get', 'free', 'ticket', 'future', 'game', 'otherwise', 'find', 'problematic', 'business', 'model', 'like', 'buy', 'ticket', 'see', 'top', 'gun', 'maverick', 'theater', 'decide', 'edit', 'tom', 'cruise', 'seat']","['Pistons', 'Cade', 'LeBron', 'Cade', 'LeBron', 'NBA', 'LBJ', 'Top Gun : Ma', 'Tom Cruise']",NEGATIVE

NBA told Mavs it would be called but in Friday’s rematch Giannis took up to 12 seconds. “I have no idea why they didn’t do that in a 1-point game.”,"I know a lot of people are shitting on the Mavs for missing free throws (and they should be), but why even have this rule if you arent going to uphold it? If you want Giannis to be able to take his time, just update the role to 15 seconds or something. If you want to have a rule, actually follow it.    The same issue with inbounding the ball. You see teams at the end of the game take well over 5 seconds to inbound the ball, but that rarely gets called.

[Example 1](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2022/12/31/0022200543/249/1162b548-ff03-2574-4017-294510c7ea26_1280x720.mp4)

It takes a smart man to acknowledge he was wrong. It takes a strong man to actually rectify that behavior. He also doesn’t shy away from it at all. It would be so easy for him to get upset at people bringing this up and say “it was so long ago, a different time, I apologized, did this, that, the other” but he legit still seems hurt by his past words.

It was so wrong of me and people have suffered. I had to grow up and really do some soul-searching. What I said was just hurtful.""","> Fifteen years later, Tim Hardaway’s words still reverberate in the world around him. They shadow him, torment him, stubbornly refuse to disappear.

> *I hate gay people … I don’t like to be around them … I am homophobic.*

> Until now, Hardaway seldom explained why he felt that way 15 years ago and how the fallout hasn’t faded. This month, in an extended phone interview with The Chronicle, Hardaway elaborated on the roots of his previous views and how those long-ago remarks affect his life today.

> “I grew up in a church, and that’s the way churches were — they instilled in you that (homosexuality) wasn’t the way you should be,” he said. “I was just taught differently. Don’t talk to them, don’t mess with them, leave them alone.

> “I never tried to talk bad about them or do hateful stuff. It was just my upbringing in church. But I’ll tell you this: It was so wrong of me, and people have suffered. I had to grow up and really do some soul-searching. What I said was just hurtful.”

> Hardaway backtracked slightly later in the interview, saying he doesn’t blame the church and “it’s on me, too.” But he was more forceful about the impact his comments have had on his post-NBA playing career.

> “A lot of people don’t want to deal with me because I said that, and I’m not getting a second chance,” Hardaway told The Chronicle. “I understand…but it does bother me. A lot of people are still holding it over me. Some organizations don’t want to talk to me. I keep moving and walk past them just like they walk past me. I’m a realist. My parents always said turn a wrong into a right, so you do what you can to show people you’re not that type of person.”

> Beyond his interactions with potential employers, Hardaway sometimes cannot escape his past when he walks out in public. He feels the stares and hears the whispers, and he’s convinced they’re not simply because he was a five-time NBA All-Star.

> “I know when people are looking at me crazy,” Hardaway said, “they’re thinking, ‘That’s the guy who said that about gay people.’ ”

> He was nearly four years removed from his final NBA game when he went on then-Miami Herald columnist Dan Le Batard’s radio show on Feb. 14, 2007. Hardaway spent five-plus seasons playing for the Heat (1996-2001) after starting his career with the Warriors. John Amaechi, a retired NBA center, had just published a memoir in which he revealed he was gay. So Le Batard asked Hardaway how he would “deal with a gay teammate,” and he said he wouldn’t want such a player on his team.

> “Well, you know, I hate gay people, so I let it be known,” Hardaway told Le Batard. “I don’t like gay people and I don’t like to be around gay people. I am homophobic. I don’t like it. It shouldn’t be in the world or in the United States.”"

edit: it's hilarious nearly every reply is trying to discredit this statline in some way. I realize stats are generally higher than they were before due to a better talent pool and rule changes that favor the offensive side of the ball. even considering all that, these are still unprecedented numbers that are being put up

also, I realize there were also a lot of possessions during this game, however Mitchell was incredibly efficient for a high scoring game like this shooting 64% from the field. it's an impressive ass game no matter how you look at it lol just enjoy the talent or watch a different sport"

u82mu4,I wish we had no injury reports and guys came back out of nowhere WWE Style,"The closest thing I’ve seen to this recently was Lamar Jackson running out of the locker room (presumably taking a shit) when the Ravens were down against the Browns with 2 minutes left in the game on 4th down. They didn’t have any QBs left as one of their QBs was already injured before the game and the other one had just gotten injured the play before. If they don’t convert on this play, the game is over and they somehow have to do it without a QB. But no, Lamar Jackson runs out [WWE Entrance Style](https://youtu.be/G_7AjOtaMtg) and throws a TD and proceeds to come back and win the game."

This kind of happened in the 2019 Blazers/OKC playoff game when Dame hit that series winner. Jusuf Nurkic came from his house to the arena and showed up mid way through the 3rd(I think), was shown on the big screen and the arena went crazy and it felt like momentum shifted in that moment, then we all know what happened to end that game."

He was almost constantly giving things away to people who needed them or just being a bro.

He won the all star game MVP one year and it came with a KIA for some reason and he ended up giving it away to a single mom.

Some days he'd just show up to a hospital and take pictures with people there and make donations to their surgeries. Completely unannounced most times too.

He donated a lot of money during the tornado, like nearly a million if I recall, he also passed out shoes and other clothes to homeless people.

He donates most of his outfits to charity too iirc.

When Russ was in the eighth grade he watched his best friend die on the basketball court. For over a year after his death he went to his friends parents house and did his chores for him to try and help them cope with the loss and help out anyway he could. He wrote his name on his shoes and says he plays for him.

When he first started coming into the room he would wear a hoodie with glasses trying to pretend he’s a nobody, but he’s a 6’3 dude with a massive physique, compared to a normal person he looks like a god, finally one of the dealers was like “no offense, Russ everyone knows it’s you.” After that he just started to come in in regular clothes."

y8klxp,"Ben Simmons' fouled out in first official game as a Nets. He had 4 pts on 2/3 shooting, 0/2 FTs, 5 rebs, 5 asts, 6 fouls in 23 minutes.","At his core, Ben Simmons is a guy who doesn't want to do anything he's not already good at.

When he came into the league his potential was enormous - he had huge wingspan, great defensive instincts, natural court vision and passing skill, the strength to finish at the rim, and more. Sure he needed to work on his shot, along with other refinements, but that would come in time.

Except it didn't, because instead of trying to shore up his weaknesses and become a complete basketball player, Ben decided he didn't need to develop new skills and instead hyper-focused on what he could already do well. Rather than put in the work to turn his weaknesses into strengths, he just stopped doing anything that would put him in an uncomfortable position on the court. Most famously his shooting atrophied into nothing, but other elements of his play fell into the same pattern, like his half-court passing.

And once opposing teams saw how he was limiting himself, it cascaded. Rather than freeing him to do a smaller set of things near-perfectly, this approach made him easy to shut down. And when Ben got shut down, he  adjusted by shrinking his game even more, trying to rely on whatever was still working while abandoning the rest, until he was taking himself out of the offense entirely. The Atlanta series and its aftermath was the most striking display of that tendency, but it had been playing out for almost his entire career. 

And now, at the ripe old age of 26, the list of things he won't try because he's afraid of failing is almost the entire NBA rulebook, leaving damn near nothing he's actually willing to *do* against competent opponents. It's a waste of what could have been generational talent, but he's got no one to blame but himself."

> I deleted a previous tweet that incorrectly stated Morant *pointed* a gun at the 17-year-old boy. The actual alleged version of events is in the story: the boy told detectives Morant had a gun visible in his waistband and placed his hand on the weapon."

11fdppj,"[Buckner] Exclusive: Ja Morant has been accused of two additional disturbing encounters (besides the Pacers' team bus incident), which includes allegedly beating up a 17-year-old boy and pointing a gun at him.","Mall incident mentioned in the article is new:

> A call from the mall
Morant is known for highflying dunks, a thirst for trash talk and a tightknit relationship with his father, Tee, who sits courtside at many games. His family has become so much a part of Morant’s brand that Tee Morant narrated the commercial launching his son’s latest major brand deal, with Powerade.

>Ja Morant was one of the stars of last year’s playoffs before the Grizzlies lost a heated series with the eventual-champion Golden State Warriors.  Two months after the loss to Golden State, Morant’s mother was at a Finish Line shoe store at a Memphis mall when she got in a dispute with a store employee, according to a Memphis Police report obtained by The Post. She called Morant, who arrived shortly after with a group of as many as nine other people.

>Confronted by the director of mall security, Morant and his friends refused the security guard’s demands to leave the mall parking lot. Police arrived and a “verbal confrontation” escalated, the report says, until someone in the group allegedly pushed the security director in the head.

>“As the group was leaving the premises … Ja Morant said, ‘Let me find out what time he gets off,’ ” police wrote in the report.

>The guard wanted to file a report, police wrote, “because he felt threatened by the statement from Ja Morant” and had been assaulted by the person who had pushed him. The “disturbing parties left the scene,” and no arrests were made.

> The Grizzlies, NBA and Morant’s agent did not respond to questions about the incident. The security guard declined to comment.

-

Also his best friend Pack seems to be a common denominator (and the punched boy's mom doesn't seem to have a good rep in the legal system):

> In an interview with police, a transcript shows, one of Morant’s attorneys, who did not respond to a request for comment from The Post, said the boy’s mother had demanded millions of dollars from Morant after the incident. “The first thing we got was a 20 million dollar demand. This is a shake down,” he said. The boy’s mother has a history of filing lawsuits that have eventually been dismissed, court records show, including a discrimination lawsuit against the city’s fire department and a lawsuit against her children’s school district after she said they were bullied on a school bus.



> The police report does not name Morant’s “best friend,” who the boy said had punched him on the other side of the jaw. But a person familiar with the lawsuit, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because it was under seal, said the friend was Pack, a childhood friend of Morant’s who is also named in the family’s lawsuit. Pack could not be reached for comment.

> Pack shouted expletives at Pacers players, the Athletic reported, until an official intervened and Pack was escorted off the floor. Later that night, the Athletic reported, the altercation continued outside the arena, where members of Morant’s entourage confronted members of the Pacers near the team’s bus. After Morant got into an SUV, a red laser was trained at members of the team from inside the car, the Athletic reported, prompting a member of the Pacers’ security team to say, “That’s 100 percent a gun.”"

w01u1f,LeBron James on The Shop: Celtics fans are “racist as f—k”,"Listen Boston fans in here, it sucks, but I would rather fanbases overreact to our racist fans than under-react. More attention on it is the best way to promote change.

Boston has race issues. Sometimes subtle, sometimes blunt and outright assholes who call people the N-word angrily. Others, it’s people who are Irish or something saying racist things about Puerto Ricans because “it’s just part of the Irish culture.” 

It’s a fucking problem. Just because no one is shitting in our players homes anymore and bloodying their home with the N-word doesn’t mean it’s all better. You think the people that did those things and didn’t move didn’t grow their children in the same fuckin way of thinking?

Edit: when I say Irish I mean white people in the US who are Americans with Irish DNA. Not people from Ireland

Edit 2: For people asking about the Irish-Puerto Rican thing: I live on the Lawrence/Andover border. Andover is rich, mostly white, and has a large Asian and Indian pocket. Lawrence is mostly Puerto Rican. So when the white people in Andover try to justify their racism and stereotypes toward Puerto Ricans, they do so by saying things like “I’m just Irish, and we don’t like their culture”"

I remember like 4-5 years ago everybody doing the math to try to see what Bron would have to do to break the scoring record. Everybody decided there would be a decline and he'd have to play into his 40's. Nobody thought he'd be going for scoring titles still."

It's supposed to separate the people that can do it from the people that can't do it… Part of greatness is longevity… I think this is a joke.”,"If the nba really wanted to fix season competition, they'd cut playoff spots significantly. Imagine only 8 spots. You'd see a lot less load management. Heck they could eliminate 7th and 8th, give the first 2 seeds a round bye, turn the first round back to best of 3 or 5, or _something_ to incentivize higher seeds because home court ain't doing it. But they won't do that either.  

The nba has created a paradigm where they want more than half the teams to make the playoffs, winning the playoffs is what matters the most BUT they also want a 82 game regular season to matter. 

 I'm sorry, but it doesn't work that way. It's a contradiction that favors load management. Either the playoffs need to become more competitive to get in, the top seeds need more incentives, or the regular season needs to be cut down to get to the actual meaningful games quicker with less wear and tear."

107dni4,Gregg Popovich Sarcastically Urges NBA To Create Four- & Five-Point Shots To Create 'Real Circus' Because No One Wants To Play Defense Anymore,Call travels and call moving screens. Bring some balance back
107dni4,Gregg Popovich Sarcastically Urges NBA To Create Four- & Five-Point Shots To Create 'Real Circus' Because No One Wants To Play Defense Anymore,Get rid of the moving screens on the perimeter and the defense would come back. It's not basketball.
107dni4,Gregg Popovich Sarcastically Urges NBA To Create Four- & Five-Point Shots To Create 'Real Circus' Because No One Wants To Play Defense Anymore,"It’s a combination of things. Thinking Basketball has a really good [video](https://youtu.be/6IPXSqOhykg) on how scoring has been made easier in the NBA. 

Essentially the rules have just become more and more tilted towards offense. The one that grinds my gears the most is offensive players being allowed to initiate contact and draw fouls. 

Sure, if a players in your space and shooting motion but you can’t just barrel into players and get rewarded. 

Combine that with 4-out spacing and some natural evolution of the game and you have the offensive boom that we have now. Where RS games just become 3pt and FT contests."
107dni4,Gregg Popovich Sarcastically Urges NBA To Create Four- & Five-Point Shots To Create 'Real Circus' Because No One Wants To Play Defense Anymore,"I watched 3 games last week where the total free throws between both teams totaled up to 60+.... felt like every time they didnt shoot a 3, there was a whistle on driving to the basket. Fuckin sucked. Stop handing the offensive player bailout calls"
107dni4,Gregg Popovich Sarcastically Urges NBA To Create Four- & Five-Point Shots To Create 'Real Circus' Because No One Wants To Play Defense Anymore,I don't think he said no one wants to play defense just that the rules make it difficult to do so. The rules are too tilted to offense now.
107dni4,Gregg Popovich Sarcastically Urges NBA To Create Four- & Five-Point Shots To Create 'Real Circus' Because No One Wants To Play Defense Anymore,"The offensive player is allowed to carry, slap you and push off, even fully extending the arm into the defender

If the defence touches them it's a foul and then they shoot after and get an and 1

If you jump straight up and the offence jumps into you, that's a foul. A pump fake and then jumping into an airborne defender shouldn't be a foul

Defence isn't allowed"
107dni4,Gregg Popovich Sarcastically Urges NBA To Create Four- & Five-Point Shots To Create 'Real Circus' Because No One Wants To Play Defense Anymore,"he's joking but it's true. i find myself half-watching, half-ignoring the games lately because of the lack of variety. it's become so predictable with almost all teams prioritizing 3s in virtually all of their sets and actions."
107dni4,Gregg Popovich Sarcastically Urges NBA To Create Four- & Five-Point Shots To Create 'Real Circus' Because No One Wants To Play Defense Anymore,This newer 'era' of basketball has made me not appreciate stats at all really. So many 40+ pt games and triple doubles etc.
107dni4,Gregg Popovich Sarcastically Urges NBA To Create Four- & Five-Point Shots To Create 'Real Circus' Because No One Wants To Play Defense Anymore,"They need to do something about it. Past the obvious rule violation...players get leg injuries a the time from this. And don't get me started on ""flopping"". It's not basketball either."
107dni4,Gregg Popovich Sarcastically Urges NBA To Create Four- & Five-Point Shots To Create 'Real Circus' Because No One Wants To Play Defense Anymore,"Reverse it. Make scoring in the paint 3 points, mid range still 2 points, then anything outside the three point line just 1 point. Watch Boban become MVP."
ut65cc,Warriors mixing up defensive coverages on Luka to start the game,We need more shit like this in this sub.
ut65cc,Warriors mixing up defensive coverages on Luka to start the game,"Upvote for actual basketball content.

Love how it’s also a mix of switching up strategies on Luka and not giving him the switch against smaller guards.

The key though is the point of attack defense has to be good otherwise Luka won’t care how much thought you put into his coverages, and to his credit, wiggins did an excellent job all night on Luka."
ut65cc,Warriors mixing up defensive coverages on Luka to start the game,This is the mistake the suns made. It wasnt just about confusing Luka but by playing the same defense over and over the Mavericks role players were able to figure it out after getting killed in Game 5 and adjusting in Game 6 and 7. I thought they just starting giving up those switches way too easily and it compromised Ayton (outside of rebound position) and CP3 (fatigue).
ut65cc,Warriors mixing up defensive coverages on Luka to start the game,Masterclass.

ut65cc,Warriors mixing up defensive coverages on Luka to start the game,There was a couple times where I could have sworn I saw Poole doing the splits with both his legs and his arms covering both Kleber in the paint and doncic at the 3pt line
ut65cc,Warriors mixing up defensive coverages on Luka to start the game,Couple years of Finals training does that
ut65cc,Warriors mixing up defensive coverages on Luka to start the game,"This is really really cool to see.

It’s funny also, because it reminds me of my HS basketball coach who used to have us switch between man and zone, or different zones mid defensive series.

It was always a train wreck and we fucking sucked. Shoutout to GSW for showing what that should actually look like lol.

Thank god when I got to college our coach had us run man, man, and sometimes when it called for it: man. Lol if you couldn’t play d your ass wasn’t getting a uniform.

Much love to you Coach Smith"
ut65cc,Warriors mixing up defensive coverages on Luka to start the game,Most interesting adjustment on the Mavs' side will be how to counter those Curry/Poole high hedges. Dubs love to do that so they can scram SC/JP back off the ball and avoid switching. Could we see re-screens or more emphasis on the short roll? Maybe the Mavs will keep Draymond's man in the strong side corner more so it's harder for Green to help in the paint & harder for him to peel switch stuff at the nail to make him the PnR screen defender. Can't wait to see what Kidd cooks up

From middle school to high school I had a huge growth spurt so instead of playing shooting guard like i had done for years my high school coaches insisted that I play power forward and i had no clue what i was doing. It was just literally 'you look like this and you're this tall so you'll play this position'. Feel like tons of dudes have the same experience.

Pretty much any sort of fast break you see today would be traveling under the 1950s NBA rules. This made it especially harder to dribble if you were bigger as it was extremely strict on what you needed to do, making it easier for the defense to steal it with a higher center of gravity. I'm not surprised coaches back then would completely coach that out of him."

I can Pat would have at least on one occasion say something to get under a teammate's skin, so to say that he hasn't seen or been a part of a fight during a practice says something. I know I'm sort of taking him at his word, and it fits my own personal narrative, but it's nice to see a player not try to sweep it under the rug or act like it's just a normal day in the office."

vpuvy3,Dame and KD are two case studies of how ring culture is ruining the game,It reminds me a bit of how Lebron got killed for forming a superteam in Miami while Carmelo got killed for only caring about the money for staying in New York.

vpuvy3,Dame and KD are two case studies of how ring culture is ruining the game,Talking about the Warriors 3-peating already.

vpuvy3,Dame and KD are two case studies of how ring culture is ruining the game,"Dame is just gonna be like Barkley, Stockton, And Reggie.

Well to be more specific he’ll be like Nash. An all time PG, who just couldn’t get over the hump in the west due to dynasties and unfortunate circumstances.

It happens, not everyone has the luck to win a ring, especially in a small market. Dirk had two opportunities and managed to win the more unlikely of the two. But it took him a lot to get it. It is what it is, Dame’s body of work should speak for itself."
vpuvy3,Dame and KD are two case studies of how ring culture is ruining the game,"If any player wins a ring with the Kings they’ll instantly achieve Legendary Status. In addition to surviving the Western Conference and defeating the beast that emerges from the Eastern Conference, they will have had to defeat their own FO/Ownership’s stupidity.

He absolutely took a pay cut for this upcoming season to help the team and basically no other reason. 

Secondly, regardless of what anyone else believes Harden certainly believes last season was an aberration. He's betting on himself to come back to form and get a bigger payday next season, hopefully with the Sixers. Again, there's just no reason to do this if he thinks he won't play better than last season. And honestly he probably still gets more on the open market based on last year's performance."

voi1js,Make No Mistake: This is The Most Valuable Trade Asset Available in NBA History,"You know, it keeps being repeated that he has a 4-year no trade clause, as though it actually means something. Why doesn't Brooklyn just keep him, then? He wants a trade, but if they don't trade him, what happens? You have to like their chances when healthy (this past year's results not withstanding), so why not go for it again?

My point being, what's to say KD gets traded, and then requests a trade next year? It was all for nothing. It's possible someone pays the motherload for him, but I wouldn't be surprised if teams are gun shy given the fact they could be in the exact situation the Nets are now - having an aging superstar who doesn't want to play for them anymore."
voi1js,Make No Mistake: This is The Most Valuable Trade Asset Available in NBA History,What's hilarious is that GS has the best package for KD if they wanted.

On a more serious note: if they settle for an Ayton package, then yeah, Bridges is def gone. Dunno why some Suns fans think Brooklyn is accepting a package without him"

I remember one time Harden made some sort of clutch shot, and the guy who posted the highlight was so excited to do so that he cut it off literally half a second after the ball went through the net.

Forbes has trashed its brand in the last 10-15 years to drive engagement. Part of this valuation is his stake in the springhill co, which is his company that produced Spacejam, and that's pretty much it. The dude raised money when capital was cheap but I doubt he could sell this at even 40% of current market value.

**EDIT**: Not being a hater on LeBron here. The dude did a great job not only of being one of the GOATs, but growing his wealth to intergenerational status. I have deep respect for what he's accomplished.

That said, you've got to be smoking something if you think the royalties to Space Jam: A New Legacy and [these other things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpringHill_Company#Filmography) is worth ~~$1 billion~~ $725 million. To provide some context, MGM sold their [_entire company and catalogue_](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/mgm-sold-to-amazon-deal-4075596/) to Amazon for **$8.45 billion**. 

Is Space Jam: a New Legacy worth ~~1/8~~ 1/10 the value of the entire James Bond franchise, Rocky/Creed Franchise, Shark Tank, Real Housewives, The Voice, and etc etc etc? Cmon' peeps (and by peeps I mean like 2 people who commented below)"

ywbxg8,"Former Atlanta Hawks player, Isaac Humphries has come out as gay",">  I went to an all-male private school from about the age of 13, where there was an unspoken expectation that everyone was straight – and that was the end of the conversation. Throw in the competitive sports world I was part of, and there were really no avenues for me to see members of the LGBTQ+ community.

>  Anyone who’s ever been in a locker room understands the sentiments that float around. There’s the unintentional derogatory slang, and ridiculing anything with a gay connotation.



It truly is understated just how common this kind of stuff is in schools and youth sports. 

Obviously it's a bit better now and more people are accepting, but christ even 5 years ago it was so much worse. Not to mention 10 years ago.

-----------------

Also, to those saying ""oh it's not a big deal who tf cares"" and acting like this is just some shite the media stir up, Donald fucking Trump literally said that Mike Pence, the fucking former vice president, wants to ""hang all the gays"". 

Hell, one entire political party if they had the chance would almost certainly make gay marriage illegal, and who knows wtf else they'd try to do.

So yes, it's a rather big deal when nearly half the country supports ideas that would at best want you to hide who you are and decry any sort of public displays of affection as some sort of queer agenda, and at worst want you to have less rights if not outright be killed cause they believe that what you're doing is unnatural and ""just a choice""."

You're too big to be hating”,"Man, Dwight has matured a lot. Great response. This is real life, where sometimes the closest you get to your dreams is playing in Taiwan, even if you work incredibly hard. No doubt everyone who made it to that league put blood sweat and tears into it."

Good looking out.

edit: 

> Do not disrespect my teammates and this league and these people in Taiwan like that. That is highly disrespectful, and it's hating.

> Everybody's [dream and goal is to make it to the NBA], and everybody not going to make it to the NBA. But we don't need people hating on other people because they're not there

this is one of the most mature and, at least from what i can tell, sincere responses to unnecessary shots that i've ever seen from an NBA player/personality. dwight's not just speaking up for himself, he's speaking up on behalf of a *lot* of people that shaq casually throws under the bus with his comments just because he's a petty old narcissist who takes every chance to take swipes at people he doesn't like, no matter how stupid the reason. it's kind of crazy to see that it's coming from dwight howard, who hasn't always been the most mature of individuals, and it's a nice reminder that everyone can do a lot of growing and learning no matter their position or accomplishments."

Dwight been living rent free on this man’s head since 09 😂 and its crazy cuz everybody knows he’s the better Center and had a better career but he’s just so insecure when it comes to Dwight
z45uko,Dwight Howard fires back at Shaq for calling the Taiwanese basketball league a ‘Lifetime Fitness league’. “You're too old to be hating.

I'm staying at Davidson.""","One thing always gets left out of these stories.  Steph, physically, was a pretty late bloomer, so for most of his HS career he was in the 5'10 range with just ok handles.  By the time he shot up to 6'2 he was a senior and most major programs had already finished recruiting by that time, hence most of his D-1 offers were ""preferred"" walk-on.

The one school that doesn't really have an excuse is VaTech, because his dad was a great player there, his mom was a great volleyball player there, and Steph was known as a great shooter/scorer at the high school level.  VT was NOT some great program, they absolutely should have offered him."

He could shoot his ass off but that wasn't a big thing like it is now, especially at his stature. Steph surprised people. Steph wasn't a great AAU player when he played but he was a killer on the HS level. I remember him single-handledly beating An'juan Wilderness, a monster in HS Dunwoody's squad. This was a talented Dunwoody team that was dominating GA HS hoops. Growing four inches going into college really helped him

&#x200B;

For those who don't know Wilderness, he was rated the next LeBron as a freshman and the #1 recruit in the nation as a freshman. He never really improved and peaked early and ended up a 3 star prospect but he was a special HS player."

It happened in college, with under armour and with the Warriors."

As an organization, you are handling a multimillion to hundred million dollar asset with your player. You can sell tickets with the potential of those stars playing, it gets a lot harder if it’s obvious those stars aren’t playing because they were overworked and now injured."

- The most important thing is winning the championship, not winning the regular season.  
- Over half the league makes the playoffs.  
- HCA is not enough of an incentive for teams to go for the higher seeds.  
- The regular season is 82 games long.  

Load management isn't going anywhere. Fresher legs and healthier players in the playoffs is far more important than a random regular season game in January. Until the equation changes, this isn't going to change.  

Load management is a player thing AND an org thing. Remember, one of the most visible one was Pop resting guys for a nationally televised game. Teams don't just always bench the stars, they bench guys across the board. Horford isn't a super star (but he's up there in age) and the Celtics have a player and rotation so they can minute restrict him during the season."

It's all about winning a championship. There were definitely a couple years when LeBron didn't win it all when he had been logging insane minutes in the regular season and it looked like he didn't have as much gas left in the tank compared to other super stars who were getting rest.

It's just the next step of evolution but I agree it can be problematic for fans."

1192b97,"New record-low, by a wide margin, for NBA All-Star Game viewership",Rising stars games were infinitely more entertaining. Those guys actually played basketball.
1192b97,"New record-low, by a wide margin, for NBA All-Star Game viewership",That’s good. If the viewership was low then there’s better odds of them actually trying to improve it.
1192b97,"New record-low, by a wide margin, for NBA All-Star Game viewership",Why would anyone want to watch the best players assemble to not play hard?
1192b97,"New record-low, by a wide margin, for NBA All-Star Game viewership",Deservedly so. That shit was trash. I watched a couple of possessions in the 2nd quarter and called it a night. To even call that a pickup game is a disgrace to pickup games
1192b97,"New record-low, by a wide margin, for NBA All-Star Game viewership",">	Sunday’s NBA All-Star Game averaged a combined 2.2 rating and 4.59 million viewers across TNT and TBS, making it easily the lowest rated and least-watched edition of the game. The previous lows were a 3.1 (2021 and 2022) and around six million viewers (2021).

All-Star Saturday Night and the Rising Stars game on Friday were also down to new lows"
1192b97,"New record-low, by a wide margin, for NBA All-Star Game viewership",Because it’s boring watching the best players in the league not take the game seriously. It’s like 48 minutes of shoot around.
1192b97,"New record-low, by a wide margin, for NBA All-Star Game viewership",I'd rather watch the All-Stars go bowling than play basketball like a kid pretending he's Steph Curry in his backyard.
1192b97,"New record-low, by a wide margin, for NBA All-Star Game viewership",NBA All star weekend is must miss TV for the most part. Not surprised.
1192b97,"New record-low, by a wide margin, for NBA All-Star Game viewership",This is the first year I haven’t even watched the 3pt contest or dunk contest. Last years dunk contest sucked so bad so I just couldn’t be bothered to devote time to it this year lol
1192b97,"New record-low, by a wide margin, for NBA All-Star Game viewership","NBA does themselves no favors by signing TV deals that require people to have a cable sub or signing up for a streaming equivalent like Sling or Fubo. Local? Shit can be a nightmare. 

Super Bowl the biggest event in US and Fox had a free 4K stream.

NBA seems to want as few people to watch their product as possible"

Giannis motivates himself by trying to improve and be better than his competition. If his competition is worse than he has nothing left to do. He’s spoken about how he got complacent after 2 MVPs and realized they didn’t mean shit. Dudes never gonna say he’s the greatest until he retires, it’s his style. I’m personally really excited for Giannis this season: dudes bag has been improving and he’s entering what should be his prime (28-30)"

vtil6w,[Windhorst] The Nets thought there would be a bidding war for Kevin Durant. They were wrong.,"He's too high risk, even if he was the best player in the NBA.

1. His performance hasn't deteriorated since his injury, but his health has. He has practically only played 50% of his regular season games since his injury. This could easily worsen since he will be 34 when the season starts.
2. There is no guarantee he won't force an out again.
3. The cost of acquiring him completely depletes the team of all quality players. The Nets have shown that a team with Durant and an all-star will still get swept in the playoffs.
4. The team needs to be prepared the same way Toronto was when they got Leonard, which is to field a team that can be in the playoffs even without Durant. No team can trade for Durant and still field a team that can do that.

Ultimately, Durant's massive contract actually works against him and the Nets. He would be significantly easier to move if he only had 1-2 years left on his contract, since it's less risk for the team trading for him, and also less assets given up to acquire him."

Surround them with some solid role players like O’Neale, Curry, Warren, Harris. That could be a decent team. Just spitballing though."
vtil6w,[Windhorst] The Nets thought there would be a bidding war for Kevin Durant. They were wrong.,"Probably doesn't help Brooklyn that KD gave 1 real destination in Phoenix (reportedly said Miami too but then reports came out that he didnt want Bam or Jimmy traded lmfao), so makes sense why so many teams would be hesistant on mortgaging 6 years worth of draft picks and young guys for 34 yr old KD"

10x1c9w,[Abdul-Jabbar] What I Think About LeBron Breaking My NBA Scoring Record,"Second, my reaction: In the months leading up to LeBron breaking my record, so much was written about how I would feel on the day he sank that record-breaking shot that I had to laugh. I’d already written several times stating exactly how I felt so there really wasn’t much to speculate about. It’s as if I won a billion dollars in a lottery and 39 years later someone won two billion dollars. How would I feel? Grateful that I won and happy that the next person also won. His winning in no way affects my winning."

10x1c9w,[Abdul-Jabbar] What I Think About LeBron Breaking My NBA Scoring Record,"> LeBron said we don’t have a relationship. He’s right—and for that I blame myself. Not for anything I did, but perhaps for not making more of an effort to reach out to him. By nature I have never been a chummy, reaching-out kind of guy (as the media was always quick to point out). I’m quiet, shy, and am such a devoted homebody that you’d think I have agoraphobia.

10x1c9w,[Abdul-Jabbar] What I Think About LeBron Breaking My NBA Scoring Record,Honestly a great read. Kareem is an awesome writer and he explained his thoughts and feelings so well. LeBron is the reason I got into the NBA and I always knew about Kareem. Getting to know Kareem further through his writing makes this moment feel really special. I don't know why but it makes me emotional.
10x1c9w,[Abdul-Jabbar] What I Think About LeBron Breaking My NBA Scoring Record,"> This is all about LeBron doing something no one else has done, about scoring more points than anyone has been able to in 75 years. There are no “yeah, buts,” just praise where it is rightfully and righteously due.

v4o3ly,It is absolutely ridiculous that there is no Saturday Finals game this year.,Game 4 is the only game that doesn't fall on a weekday in my timezone. So fucking annoying
v4o3ly,It is absolutely ridiculous that there is no Saturday Finals game this year.,There's almost never Saturday Finals games? Last year is the only one I can find in like the last 10 years
v4o3ly,It is absolutely ridiculous that there is no Saturday Finals game this year.,This is not a new thing. For YEARS the NBA Finals were Tuesday/Thursday/Sunday/repeat.
v4o3ly,It is absolutely ridiculous that there is no Saturday Finals game this year.,"Sunday must be the primest of prime time television for Americans. They probably go out on Saturdays to either socialize or just go on a trip, so Sundays are family time, watching sports, inviting people over, etc."
v4o3ly,It is absolutely ridiculous that there is no Saturday Finals game this year.,"What if I told you that there has been [exactly one NBA Finals game on a Saturday in the past 40 years](https://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2021/07/nba-finals-ratings-game-5-bucks-suns-saturday-night-abc/)? And that the viewership for that game ([2021 Game 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_television_ratings#Game-by-game_breakdown_by_year_\(1974%E2%80%93present\))) actually decreased from Game 4, despite that practically never happening historically?

It's also pretty telling that this post has 7,000 upvotes at a 92% ratio considering it's based on false information that's easily verifiable."
v4o3ly,It is absolutely ridiculous that there is no Saturday Finals game this year.,"The Finals haven’t been on a Saturday for more than 20 years. 

When ABC took over in 2003, they did Thursday, Sunday, Tuesday.

In 2014 they switched to 2-2-1-1-1 and in 2016 they added the extra rest days between games 4-7.

Saturdays have historically been terrible for ratings. It’s the least watched day for TV. NBC begged the NHL to not have them start the Stanley Cup Finals on Saturday because ratings were so terrible. The extra day between Games 1-2 for the NBA Finals makes it super obvious they’re avoiding Saturday. 

TL;DR: No one watches TV on a Saturday. So they put it on Sunday to maximize ratings.

I do agree that they can put it earlier on Sunday though. Maybe a 7:30 pm tip instead of 8 so the fourth quarter can begin before 10 lol

EDIT: Yes, Game 5 was on a Saturday last year. An anomaly for the past 30ish (40ish?) years because of COVID. Compared to the other games in the series, it did modestly well. Third-best rated game in the series. Couple of reasons: As the series goes longer, ratings usually rise. A Saturday game late in the series is more justifiable than an early game (e.g., a game 2). 

For those of us who remember: in the late 90s and early 2000s, the World Series started on a Saturday. It went: Sat-Sun-T-W-Th-S-Su. 

Wonder why it changed? Ratings. MLB shifted WS to start on Wednesday. But the ratings were still terrible because they went up against the NFL. So they shifted to Tuesday"
v4o3ly,It is absolutely ridiculous that there is no Saturday Finals game this year.,"Saturday night isn't a big night for TV. Sunday night is. Simple as that.

EDIT: I'll also note that Game 1 of the '91 Finals was the last afternoon game"
v4o3ly,It is absolutely ridiculous that there is no Saturday Finals game this year.,"> The Saturday Finals game has become the one day the whole world actually watches the NBA Finals regardless of timezone 

What are the numbers on this?"
v4o3ly,It is absolutely ridiculous that there is no Saturday Finals game this year.,OP is a dumbass
v4o3ly,It is absolutely ridiculous that there is no Saturday Finals game this year.,">the one day the whole world actually watches the NBA Finals regardless of timezone 

But the league makes most of their money from the domestic tv deal. The NBA isn't some benevolent entity out to bring basketball to as many people as possible, they're trying to take every goddamn dollar it can and stuff it in the owners pockets."

I knew if I was in Milwaukee and I set that I’d foul out in the first quarter, but playing in Golden State, when they started to become that underdog team that was building up, I knew once Steph or Klay got hot, the refs would be in the moment as well.

I could literally clothesline someone off the next pindown, I know Klay just hit 3 in a row, the crowd’s on their feet as he’s getting his 4th and I could punch somebody in the face on a screen, knock em out and they wouldn’t call it. Klay would get his 4th 3, and even the refs would go ‘Wow’ (and ignore it), it was crazy.

Then I get traded to Dallas to set those same screens and I’d get 3 fouls in the first quarter, It was just crazy with the stuff I used to get away with there.”

11hbzm0,[Meta] This sub sucks now,"I made a multi-reddit for myself that includes every NBA teams subreddit. That way I get ~~nuanced~~ discussion that pertains to specific teams. I can look at the front page every day and get a snapshot of what's going on around the league. 

There are also plenty of memes, emotional back and forths, overreactions, etc., but in a more genuine ""this is my team and this is what i think"" way.  As opposed to just the constant stream of toxicity and braindead takes ESPN / r/nba produces.

Edit: oversold the depth of the discussion when just looking at the front page of the multireddit. It still provides a much better snapshot of the entire league as opposed to exclusively national narratives. For quality discussion tho you do have to go into the subreddit and seek it out. Usually in post game or day after threads. Still easier than finding it on r/nba but not as straightforward as just creating a multi.

Opinions on the vaccine aside, the bottom line is he is not doing what he needs to do to be on the court with his team this year, and whether it’s fair or not that’s the reality.

That being said this is stupid at this point. He can be in the building, sit courtside, be within a foot of all the players and fans but he can’t play? I don’t like what Kyrie has gone this year from a basketball perspective, and I’m generally a proponent of getting the vaccine, but at this point keeping him off the court isn’t doing anything at all."

Like, he's walking dead because he's going to be going eventually and his turnovers and bad shots lead to a loss of momentum or suck energy from the team. 

I never have ever thought he was a bad dude. Guys freaking awesome as a human being. And the kind of athlete I wish everyone was. Inspirational for all the good reasons. Just ... not good at playing basketball at this level anymore and on a bad contract. I wish it weren't the case. 

Nothing but admiration and respect for his past glories. I hope he gets a chip one day, but it's going to have to be like Vince Carter's chip. As a piece and a vet finding a niche on a great team with younger talent."

Shaq had seasons where he shot 60% while getting double teamed a lot of the time.

The fact that Wallace could hold him to 63% one-on-one allowed the other Pistons to smother the rest of the Lakers and double Kobe (who shot under 40% against the Pistons in the finals).

So there are context when 51% is good."

I thought it was a good shot, great look, he had been shooting it well, and he was killing it out there. It's just a make or miss league.


Edit: That shot wasn't a brick. A brick is a badly missed shot, like some of those Max Strus and Marcus Smart threes that hit the backboard and back iron before bouncing out. Jimmy's three had good direction, just not enough power. A little bit more and he drains it."

Everybody can probably agree it wasn’t the most likely make and driving was safer. Everybody can probably agree that the Heat still are at best marginally below 50% likely to win in that scenario unless he gets the foul. 

Jimmy himself knew the risk and he has to live with the criticism as much as he would have lived with the adulation if it ended up the game winner. I’m sure he can live with it as he says."

- It claims that Jews were responsible for the slave trade 

- Denies the Holocaust took place

- Declares that Jews are impostors and that blacks are the real Jews and God's chosen people

- Says Jews rule every industry in the world, control every facet of society and dominate the media ""helping Satan deceive the world""

- Also claims that racism towards blacks started with Jews and and that anti-Black racism began in Jewish texts, saying that Judaism teaches that blacks are cursed 

- Proclaims that ""many famous high-ranking Jews"" worship Satan

This is the gist of it, but it also uses a bunch of made up quotes and references fabricated texts like The Protocols of the Elders of Zion which warn of  a Jewish plan for global domination. The entire thing is just abhorrently racist hate speech and disinformation disguised as a ""documentary"" and Kyrie is a complete piece of shit for using his platform to promote it.

> And… we think it’s cowardice or we’re weak if we go get help. 

I hate bully culture so much, especially because going to get help for mental/emotional trauma is one of the *strongest* things we can do as people because it means we're allowing ourselves to be vulnerable.

That same mindset once prevented me from getting therapy when I needed it - I even gaslighted myself into thinking I was ""weak"" for even considering acknowledging my personal trauma. Luckily, I eventually broke through that and got therapy, best decision I ever made. But fuck it was tough to man up, break through that mentality and actually address it."

My squad went through some shit and dudes were absolutely internally destroyed but nobody really understood what their emotions were or that other guys felt the same. A few years later at a campfire one guy was like “do you guys also cry a lot and get scared sometimes for no reason” and then everybody sort of realized what was going on and the majority sought group treatment. 

Step one is acknowledging, and that’s honestly the hardest part. I still haven’t really gotten there yet, although clearly I am vaguely aware something is off."

The basketball is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the plays will go over a typical viewer's head.

The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these plays, to realize that they're not just plays- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike basketball truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Kevin's existencial catchphrase ""Lets take it to Twitter,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Burners and Alts.

wcm5cb,Yao Ming blocks Shaquille O'Neal's first three shots and scores Houston's first three buckets in his first meeting against the Big Aristotle,"Man, growing up in Houston I absolutely loved Yao. Pure class, came over here with limited English and cultural understanding of the NBA and man did he represent his country, himself, and the city of Houston so well.

And on the court he was the proto unicorn. Big, mobile, blocked or altered shots, soft touch, could shoot the mid range, shot ~90% on free throw, and had some dream shakes in his back pocket. No doubt he could have shot at least 35% from three in todays NBA.

Go watch the clip where he goes behind his back on the break against the blazers - world class. Unfortunately at that size and with the run of the NBA and international schedule, injuries broke him down.

He’s doing fine, owns one of the largest wine distributors in China, the Shanghai Sharks, and is in politics. Love that he’s found purpose beyond basketball.

v42e2d,Celtics were “open” or “wide open” on 38 of the 41 three point attempts they took last night against the Warriors in game 1.,Tatum had 13 assists and maybe just as many hockey assists
v42e2d,Celtics were “open” or “wide open” on 38 of the 41 three point attempts they took last night against the Warriors in game 1.,"Shot tracking is pretty trash though, to be fair. 
It classifies *everything* as open. The wide open number is the one that actually matters. Like they consider all of Dame's stepback Iso 3s ""open"" because he created a little bit of space

23 wide open? Yeah that's too many. But almost all shots get classified as open or wide open

Edit: Like over their entire season, 32.3 of their 37.0 3PA are open or wide open, or **87%**

Double Edit: Like [this](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&ContextMeasure=FG3M&EndPeriod=0&EndRange=28800&GameID=0022100246&PlayerID=203081&RangeType=0&Season=2021-22&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&StartPeriod=0&StartRange=0&TeamID=1610612757&flag=3&sct=plot&section=game) was called an open 3

v42e2d,Celtics were “open” or “wide open” on 38 of the 41 three point attempts they took last night against the Warriors in game 1.,Draymond didnt even try to contest on any closeouts for some reason
v42e2d,Celtics were “open” or “wide open” on 38 of the 41 three point attempts they took last night against the Warriors in game 1.,"Yeah, I think [NBA.com](https://NBA.com) might be a little off on their tracking here. Second Spectrum has it classified into Heavily Contested, Lightly Contested & Uncontested and they have it tracked as 17 Heavily Contested, 16 Lightly Contested & 8 Uncontested.

Now to be clear, this is still a lot of open threes. The Warriors were focusing on players driving and helping off shooters (a strategy that worked great against the Mavs who couldn't hit a shot for most of that series). I think your conclusion is still right even if the tracking numbers are a little wonky."
v42e2d,Celtics were “open” or “wide open” on 38 of the 41 three point attempts they took last night against the Warriors in game 1.,Warriors playing that playoff-Jazz defence
v42e2d,Celtics were “open” or “wide open” on 38 of the 41 three point attempts they took last night against the Warriors in game 1.,Warriors for some reason went from an meh offensive team and incredible defensive one in the RS to the exact opposite in the playoffs

xfcwwy,"[Holmes] Phoenix Suns minority owner Jahm Najafi, who owns the second-largest stake in the team behind majority owner Robert Sarver, just released a statement. In it, Najafi writes, in part: “I am calling for the resignation of Robert Sarver.”","Full statement:

>Due to the NBA’s investigation and findings, I have no choice but to speak up on behalf of the hundreds of you who have been impacted by your interactions with Robert Sarver and the resulting investigation of his conduct. I first and foremost want to give my deepest thanks to all of you who garnered the courage to share your experiences, as difficult as it may have been, to help piece together a clearer picture of what work life must have been like for you over these past 18 years.

>There should be zero tolerance for discriminatory actions of any level, in any setting, let alone a professional one. There is no question that the findings determined that Mr. Sarver’s lewd, misogynist, and racist conduct had a substantial negative impact on you and has no place in our society. The report confirmed by multiple eyewitnesses that Robert Sarver used the “N-word” at least five times. The report confirmed Sarver engaged in conduct demeaning of female and pregnant employees. The report confirmed Sarver made crude and sexually inappropriate comments in professional settings. The report confirmed Sarver made inappropriate comments about the physical appearance of female employees and other women and made inappropriate workplace physical conduct toward male employees.

>WORDS AND ACTIONS MATTER.

>Similar conduct by any CEO, executive director, president, teacher, coach, or any other position of leadership would warrant immediate termination. The fact that Robert Sarver “owns” the team does not give him a license to treat others differently than any other leader. The fact that anyone would find him fit to lead because of this “ownership” position is forgetting that NBA teams belong to the communities they serve. Team investors are merely temporary stewards. If we, as sports leaders, are not held to the same standards then how can we expect a functional society with integrity and respect on any level? We owe it to you: employees, players, partners, and your families to provide the same positive workplace environment we would require of any other business.

>I cannot in good judgment sit back and allow our children and future generations of fans to think that this behavior is tolerated because of wealth and privilege. Therefore, in accordance with my commitment to helping eradicate any form of racism, sexism and bias, as Vice Chairman of the Phoenix Suns, I am calling for the resignation of Robert Sarver. While I have no interest in becoming the managing partner, I will work tirelessly to ensure the next team steward treats all stakeholders with dignity, professionalism and respect."

CJ is in a really tough situation but anything that isn't ""Kyrie Irving is far away from being back in the NBA"" isn't going to satisfy most fans or come off as genuine. for CJ, as union president, the biggest issue is the players, through both Simmons/Kyrie situations, are about to lose most leverage they have for a lockout next year.

the NBA's players have the *best* contract situation in pro sports: fully guaranteed deals. but Ben Simmons last year created legitimate grievance from the owners' perspective and this Kyrie situation amplifies it - why do these players deserve fully guaranteed deals if they don't go to work when people were massively unemployed in the last few years? why do they if they aren't even decent citizens?

it may be the first time a solid majority of fans want the players crushed in the next lockout and i wouldn't blame them one bit.

while fans may be disgusted at how the Nets, Adam Silver or even Joe Tsai have personally handled this, the lasting impression from this entire mess is the NBPA flipped the bird to most of their non-black fanbase this week because these players are highly visible, extremely rich and just *keep saying the wrong thing*."

""He's displayed empathy now""

Were you waiting this long to speak up so that he can apologise and you can take a neutral stand - both denounce antisemitism and not bash him?It is a learning experinece but he doubled down on his views. And none of you spoke up. Making up excuses for him like ""i don't think he actually watched the movie"" is ridiculous."

“He's displayed empathy now. I think this is a learning experience in which I don't think he understood the magnitude of the movie because he didn't watch it. I don't think he understood the magnitude of the people that were affected, how they were impacted and how fast hate can spread and how this can snowball.""

Sounds like he’s making excuses for Kyrie, well after the fact, including completely making up that Kyrie didn’t watch the movie… wtf? Kyrie had plenty of chances to understand the magnitude of the impact before he apologized, which only came after there were real consequences to him."

""I think now we're heading in the direction of addressing it appropriately"" at least suggests he believes there hasn’t been much real atonement for this transgression, but highlighting the still empty carefully crafted apology seemed like only acknowledgement of the fact that he finally didn’t respond with that ""but I didn’t post it and I know who I am so I can’t be sorry"" bullshit. Tightroping hatred in the league to avoid being hated in the league is quite…..something."

I watched it and you'd have to be a complete idiot (tbf Kyrie is) or not actually watch the movie to think it's a good idea to promote it. Like, there's maybe 10% of content in the movie that isn't complete obvious Anti-Semitic tropes. 

The movie explicitly mentions that the holocaust wasn't real. Kyrie argued that he only agreed with certains parts of the film but most of the movie is some variation of ""Jews control the world and they are lying about it"". You'd have to be real idiot to even consider endorsing that movie and the fact that he did makes me wonder if he actually watched it. Considering he doubled down on it."

vx8dsq,5 reasons why 1996 Bulls will not win a single game in today's NBA,I'll tell you one thing. They would eat 2022 Nuggets easily
vx8dsq,5 reasons why 1996 Bulls will not win a single game in today's NBA,"It's not that you're wrong, exactly, it's just that this is completely irrelevant. This is just classic r/nba nephew shit. People drink a glass of milk or read a blog post and suddenly they are an expert on livestock.

According to the most recent CBA, **U.S. players must be at least one year removed from high school and 19 years of age (by the end of that calendar year) before entering the draft.**

Bulls, much like cows, may generally live ten to twelve years. Most bulls will remain active in the herd for closer to four or five years due to feet and leg, structural, and fertility problems, temperament concerns, or injuries. Though they can live to 18-20, this is far from the norm.

Out of the 1996 Bulls, I grant you that most will successfully graduate high school if shepherded through the proper modern-day AAU program. However, according to Official Guinness Records, the oldest bull ever to have participated in an athletic competition was Red Wolf from Herrington Cattle Company who bucked until the 2000 World Rodeo Finals and was **13 years old.**

Yet you would stage a basketball game that involves *nearly 2000 morbidly geriatric animals.* Animals with bad feet, bad legs, bent backs, limp dicks, and shitty attitudes. And you are talking about docility?? What the everliving fuck is a 700 kg sack of potatoes that can't even get off the truck without a hydraulic lift going to do on a basketball court? 

Stand there and try to breathe, that's what. A 19 year-old bull is just furniture. Old, smelly, heavy furniture.

this is ignorant garbage, op. Delete your account"

""It would be one thing if Malone was unable to financially provide for his son, but he made more than $100 million during his NBA career. The Salt Lake (Utah) Tribune reported that when Bell's grandparents initially took Malone to court for paternity in 1986, his second year with the Jazz, they requested Malone pay $200 a week. Malone didn't respond to the suit, but a Louisiana judge ruled he was Bell's father -- after a paternity test showed that was indeed accurate -- and ordered Malone to pay $125 a week, plus past and future medical expenses. Malone claimed that was too much and later reached a confidential out-of-court settlement with Bell's family between 1988 and 1989.""

Your weed will arrive safely in style, guaranteed.  This reminds me of a great Mitch Hedberg  (RIP) joke: ""I like the FedEx driver because he's a drug dealer & he doesn't even know it... And he's always on time"""
wfj64q,Former NBA player Iman Shumpert arrested on Felony marijuana charge in Texas,'felony marijuana charge' seems like a fucked concept

2. Shump is a dumbass for trying to take 6 ounces through an airport. That's what your dipshit buddy is for. Or just buy it at your destination. You played in the NBA, I can't imagine its at all hard to find a guy to sell you a QP for cheap so he can say he did it"
wfj64q,Former NBA player Iman Shumpert arrested on Felony marijuana charge in Texas,Hilarious that were willing to trade war criminals to get US citizens out of weed charges over seas while doing the exact same shit within our borders to our own citizens.
wfj64q,Former NBA player Iman Shumpert arrested on Felony marijuana charge in Texas,"they sell weed at smoke shops now (delta 8/10 and thc-0), time to legalize the flowers"

Gym teacher blows the whistle and says, look, Billybean is overthere by himself, what do you think a good play would be, pass the ball for an easy layup.

He blows the whistle, this dude named Roger throws the ball toward me, it bounces and hits me in the face, knocks my glasses off and goes out of bounds. I grab them and first thing i see is the teacher just laughing and shrugging.

There should multiple cuts every play."
z3pu25,"[Highlight] As Mike Breen asks “Does Luka need to get his team mates more involved”, Luka throws a perfect full court pass to Tim Hardaway who turns it over","The warriors ruined how people judge stars imo.

z3pu25,"[Highlight] As Mike Breen asks “Does Luka need to get his team mates more involved”, Luka throws a perfect full court pass to Tim Hardaway who turns it over","I always hated that narrative that ""great players make his teammates better"".    Charles Barkley said it best when he was in Philly.   That Magic Johnson got to make perennial All Stars Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Jamaal Wilkes and Norm Nixon better.   Larry Bird got to make perennial All Stars Cedric Maxwell, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish better.   I had to make Scotty Brooks and Manute Bol better.

That's why a strong team ownership and a competent front office matters.   Why drafting well, smart free agency moves and player development matters.  Putting the weight of making marginal or role players better on the backs of the superstars is a cop out that takes the responsibility off the coach and front office.   If Luka makes a great pass that Tim Hardaway turns over, eventually he'll get frustrated and want to either go to another team to squad up with other superstars or entice other stars to Dallas....and people will vilify him for it.   Tying a player's legacy to championships make them want to do that or else they'll have it hanging over their heads forever, which isn't fair.    

Luka is killing it, but the fact that his best teammates so far in his career have been Jalen Brunson, Porzingas  and Christian Woods is almost criminal."

tgh6jm,"Ex-GM Donnie Nelson sues Dallas Mavericks, says he was fired for reporting sexual misconduct.","> Former longtime Dallas Mavericks general manager Donnie Nelson sued the team Thursday, alleging that owner Mark Cuban fired him last summer as retaliation for reporting that Cuban's chief of staff sexually harassed and sexually assaulted his nephew during a job interview in 2020.
> 
> The lawsuit also alleges that Cuban offered Nelson, who was fired in June, $52 million to withdraw a wrongful termination claim and sign a confidentiality statement related to the alleged harassment and abuse of his nephew.
> 
> Nelson, in his lawsuit filed in Dallas County court, says Jason Lutin, described in the lawsuit as Cuban's ""right-hand man"" and who still works for the team, assaulted and harassed his nephew in a hotel room during the 2020 All-Star Weekend in Chicago. 

Holy shit."
tgh6jm,"Ex-GM Donnie Nelson sues Dallas Mavericks, says he was fired for reporting sexual misconduct.","It is kind of incredible that after the sexual assault case in 2018, they still had a young, hopeful-to-be-hired guy invited by Lutin up to his hotel room for an 'interview' in 2020.

Like I don't know if abuse occurred, but that's just horrible 'interview' practice. And overall, I doubt Cuban learned anything from 2018."

He refused to fully participate. I will say it again, everything he said is a lie.""

Mark better hope there isn’t any credence to Nelson’s accusations:

He’s already confirmed there was an investigation (in fact, *multiple* investigations) into the incident and that Nelson was fired as a result."

Offseason would be basically many long months with really zero NBA content.

His response kind of reminds me of what Dame said when asked back in 2017 if playoff expectations created pressure for him:

Lillard: Pressure, nah. Fam, this is just playing ball. Pressure is the homeless man, who doesn’t know where his next meal is coming from. Pressure is the single mom, who is trying to scuffle and pay her rent. We get paid a lot of money to play a game. Don’t get me wrong — there are challenges. But to call it pressure is almost an insult to regular people.

y0htzk,Ja Morant winning MIP set a bad precedent for the award,The best MIP award was Julius Randle when he did a 180 on his career over a single off-season. Role player to all-star.
y0htzk,Ja Morant winning MIP set a bad precedent for the award,"If Zion gets it the award is officially meaningless.  Might as well just rename it ""MVP for players under 25"""
y0htzk,Ja Morant winning MIP set a bad precedent for the award,Ja wasn't even the MIP of his own team lol
y0htzk,Ja Morant winning MIP set a bad precedent for the award,"Yeah this could quickly just turn into the MVP award for second or third year lottery picks. Against the spirit of the award imo, really don’t like the direction we’re headed with this"
y0htzk,Ja Morant winning MIP set a bad precedent for the award,Poole Garland Murray. My vote was Poole but any of those 3 winning would have made sense. Ja was already an all star caliber player.
y0htzk,Ja Morant winning MIP set a bad precedent for the award,"I actually agree with this take. Give it to the role players who bust their ass, not the guy who was supposed to be the franchise player..."
y0htzk,Ja Morant winning MIP set a bad precedent for the award,"lmao if Zion wins MIP the award lost its meaning completely. Although Ja Morant shouldn't have won, his numbers did take a leap.  For Zion to actually deserve it he'd have to put up 30+ ppg, or greatly improve his assist and rebound numbers"
y0htzk,Ja Morant winning MIP set a bad precedent for the award,"For what it’s worth, MIP award is the successor of the Comeback player of the year award. It really has no place being given to great young phenoms who take that expected jump, but it’s easier for the voters that way I guess

Edit: for further context, PG and Kevin Love both won it in 3rd seasons, just like Ja, so it’s not strictly an age thing. But I think it’s because they made a leap from just a good player to an all star caliber one in that season; whereas Ja already was. It’s just odd because there were better candidates.Hell, Morant wasn’t even the best candidate on his team."
y0htzk,Ja Morant winning MIP set a bad precedent for the award,"> Zion himself literally averaged 27ppg in his second year how can he possibly be considered for this award?!?!

If he averages 54 ppg this season I think he deserves it."
y0htzk,Ja Morant winning MIP set a bad precedent for the award,It should’ve been Poole. Everyone said when they gave it to Ja. I’m not even a Ja hater like most of this sub but it’s so dumb that he won it

ygydhg,I think we all need to give a shout-out to San Antonio for doing the right thing without being forced to.,"For those who don't follow the Spurs -- they invested A LOT in this dude.  Primo was openly discussed as a ""future face of the franchise.""  He was on all their marketing and affiliate materials.  The front office had all the faith in the world he would be a future superstar, and was not shy about sharing those opinions.  It's not an exaggeration to say this is/was a gut punch to the fanbase.  Some things are more important though, as Pop always says, for which this serves as a reminder.  I just wish the Spurs' decisive move here wasn't such an abnormality among professional teams.  I get that there is money and wins and feelings involved, but in instances like these, there's other people involved too.  You gotta do what's right.

This game was during November of his rookie year. It doesn't at all explain the shit he's going through now.

Simmons was very good in his 4 years in Philly: 3 All Star appearance, an All NBA team, averaging 15/8/8 on above average TS%. He never took jump shots, but he delivered consistent rim pressure and was always top 5 in the league in shots at the rim. Fans were obviously disappointed that he never improved from his rookie year given his lofty prospect hype, but he was still an All Star level player.

This year, he's averaging just 7 PPG and has stopped attacking the rim. He's a shell of his former self, and it has nothing to do with trash talk during the first month of his rookie year."

They're small, scoring guards. They could absolutely benefit from adding a true point guard to their team to better run their offense, especially during slumps and in late game situations. Tatum, Brown, and Smart were not good enough in those moments and that's why they took 7 games to win the ECSF and the ECF and they eventually lost in 6 in the Finals. They had enough talent in every other facet of the game that they easily could have rolled to a championship with the right true point guard."

zxdo1j,Is it ok to stop pretending that that the Luka/Trae trade was a win-win for both Dallas and Atlanta yet?,Luka playing under Nate McMillian would be a loss for us all as fans. Be thankful.
zxdo1j,Is it ok to stop pretending that that the Luka/Trae trade was a win-win for both Dallas and Atlanta yet?,Probably one of the few good move Dallas has made in the past 5+ seasons
zxdo1j,Is it ok to stop pretending that that the Luka/Trae trade was a win-win for both Dallas and Atlanta yet?,Atleast Trae Young is a multi time all star and has all nba honors. Both Bagley and Ayton haven’t done either of those things.
zxdo1j,Is it ok to stop pretending that that the Luka/Trae trade was a win-win for both Dallas and Atlanta yet?,Dallas won that trade no doubt.
zxdo1j,Is it ok to stop pretending that that the Luka/Trae trade was a win-win for both Dallas and Atlanta yet?,In the same way can we stop acting like the suns never absolutely fumbled the first pick. I get ayton is a good fit on the team and they made a finals run couple years ago. But imagine if they took luka first and traded for a legit center instead of cp3. The suns with dbook luka and bridges would of been a dynasty.
zxdo1j,Is it ok to stop pretending that that the Luka/Trae trade was a win-win for both Dallas and Atlanta yet?,"They definitely lost the trade, but it wasn’t a huge loss if you get what I mean.

Like the Bucks trading Dirk on draft night is a major L because their return literally amounted to zero while Dirk became a top 20 player ever. 

Trae Young is All-NBA caliber so it’s not like they got scraps for Luka, they got the second best player in the draft as of now. But of course, Luka has the talent to become top 20 all time himself, maybe higher if the Mavs get some talent around him and he wins rings."
zxdo1j,Is it ok to stop pretending that that the Luka/Trae trade was a win-win for both Dallas and Atlanta yet?,Luka is too good for y'all to be this insecure
zxdo1j,Is it ok to stop pretending that that the Luka/Trae trade was a win-win for both Dallas and Atlanta yet?,"Dallas for sure won that trade, but Trae Young is still a beast. I don't like how Luka's success will always downplay Trae's value for the Hawks."
zxdo1j,Is it ok to stop pretending that that the Luka/Trae trade was a win-win for both Dallas and Atlanta yet?,"This kind of post baffles me. Is OP personally offended by the trade debate? Luka is better than Trae, and Trae is a good player. How much shitting on Trae needs to occur to pacify OP?"

The majority of those misses have been sitting out back to backs as precautionary (20/297) and 7 were for COVID. He's been physically healthy for just shy of 80% of games since leaving New York (235/297).

His only real injuries have been some rolled ankles (4x), meniscus surgery recovery (9 games to start the 2021 season), and back tightness."

AD will go to the ground clutching a limb, go to the locker room for 5 minutes, then come back and finish the game. I'm pretty sure I've seen more games where he'll do that rather than just have a normal game. Its impressive he fights through obvious pain, but it is obvious, and that is memorable."

Why pick 4 years? 4 years ago KD blew out his Achilles and didn't play at all. 

In the last 3 years AD has played in only 49% of games. In that stretch KD has played in 58% of total games and Kyrie 57%. Both Kawhi and Zion were shut down for the entirety of the 21-22 season but in their last 3 seasons they did play in, they played 63% and 51% of games respectively.

udjsky,THE CHICAGO BULLS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED FROM CHAMPIONSHIP CONTENTION,"Honestly, all things considered, Chicago slightly exceeded expectations with this series. Pushed them Game 1, stole Game 2, and got clobbered the last 3 but no Ball/LaVine + the free fall the team was in at the end of the regular season, it could have been worse.

yz18bd,[Highlight] Joel Embiid commits a flagrant 1 on Giannis in transition,"I used to play like Embiid. He is reckless on purpose. When I see Embiid play as he is now it reminds me of how I used to play and it is frustrating and pisses me off that the NBA allows it. Not proud of it, I was known as Shaq on my local streetball court and went through a phase when I charged hard at everything. Big hard turns to my blindside, didn't care who was there. Charge right into the lane. Smash into the best offensive player on D while going for the ball, come what may. Limited offensive moves. So make no mistake about it. Embiid knows what he's doing. He knows people will be injured. He knows his skillset is limited and this is how he can win. He knows people will give way when he drives, think twice on their drives, etc. He will only be stopped by a stronger player and/or fearless players like Giannis, Gasol, Draymond, etc. Or by an obviously more skilled player with equal Type A like Ibaka. He didn't intend to injure, but he certainly intends to show you that he doesn't care if you get hurt when he rumbles into you. At least that's how I used to play. But that was streetball. Eventually I got more moves, played w better players, played real basketball w refs. There's no doubt in my mind the NBA has some kind of edict coming down, telling the refs to let him run amok."

vjolxp,ESPN’s draft coverage last night was a disaster,Same thread every year lol
vjolxp,ESPN’s draft coverage last night was a disaster,"ESPN has generally been a disaster with their coverage of everything for many years now - they long ago moved away from actual meaty sports discussion and towards human interest stories and clickbait controversy.  

Live college sports are the only thing they do reasonably well anymore, and even that isn't immune to the nonsense.

So the draft is basically exactly what should have been expected."
vjolxp,ESPN’s draft coverage last night was a disaster,"Yeah Woj sucks, I get the dude is just doing his job and I’m not gonna majorly hate on him, but man he sucks the fun out of shit whenever he’s on air."

Their conclusion is no. Their second conclusion was that MVP voters had a beef with Dirk Nowitzki in 2002-2004, who was getting way less MVP votes than he should have."
11m6lux,[First Take] First Take apologizes for Kendrick Perkins saying 80% of MVP voters are white,"The dumbest part is he claimed that Nash, Dirk and Jokic are the only players ever to win MVP while not being top 10 in scoring. Then when people called him out for that, with examples, Magic and Bill Russell, he changed it to since 1990. He says that CP3 should have won over Jokic, the only problem there is CP3 was 48th in scoring. Just a complete dumb ass all the way here"

But when KAT is on the court their centre can't play their role and the Grizzlies got outrebounded **46-35**, that's a huge part of their team identity just gone. Either they need to get a bit more creative with how they guard KAT to keep Adams back in the paint, or they need the rest of the roster to adapt.

Only made the Long Island Nets roster in the first place as a tryout player after going undrafted in 2020 and sitting out the 2020-21 season to rework his entire game with his trainer (who is his brother). Worked his way from bench reserve to key starter over the course of the season resulting in him winning G League MIP. Finished the season as the league's third-highest scorer and was the only one in the top 15 to not see a single 10-Day contract throughout last season.

u1xdap,Opinion: The 76ers trading Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith should be remembered as an all time bad draft move.,There's a universe where the Sixers have a Simmons/Covington/Bridges/Embiid core and re like one of the best defense of all time
u1xdap,Opinion: The 76ers trading Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith should be remembered as an all time bad draft move.,What happen to Zhaire Smith? Is he on a team?
u1xdap,Opinion: The 76ers trading Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith should be remembered as an all time bad draft move.,The funniest part is Bridges would literally be the most ideal piece that team needs
u1xdap,Opinion: The 76ers trading Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith should be remembered as an all time bad draft move.,"I hated it in the moment.

I remember hearing a pre-draft interview and being blown away at how well he talked about basketball. I always feel like there is zero chance someone like that could ever bust. He was also the *perfect* player for the Sixers needs (then and now lol). Having such a good shot at, minimum, a scalable 3&D player to play alongside Embiid's prime (and he went well above expected potential) and pissing off what Zach Lowe would call ""the basketball gods"" trading him after the entire mom story got all that traction...

Well, it worked out for Mikal. Delighted how good he's become."
u1xdap,Opinion: The 76ers trading Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith should be remembered as an all time bad draft move.,Sixers had a lot of those between Hinkie getting kicked out and Morey. Trading away all of their assets in 2019 and then letting Jimmy walk to give Harris and Horford as much money as they did is an example
u1xdap,Opinion: The 76ers trading Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith should be remembered as an all time bad draft move.,I don't think that's totally fair because didn't Zhaire literally almost DIE in a freak accident and then he lost like 20lbs and couldn't play for months?
u1xdap,Opinion: The 76ers trading Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith should be remembered as an all time bad draft move.,"They still got Tobias Harris out of it. I don't know if that's good or bad though lol.

After all the draft whiffs the prior 5-6 years (minus Book), it was really nice to hit a homerun on not one, but two picks in that draft."
u1xdap,Opinion: The 76ers trading Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith should be remembered as an all time bad draft move.,I feel like it's not fair to say that considering Zhaire Smith had his career derailed by a severe allergy that nobody knew about
u1xdap,Opinion: The 76ers trading Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith should be remembered as an all time bad draft move.,"I mean yeah we all hated how it went down, but it wasn’t Zaire for Bridges.

It was the 10th pick (Bridges) for the 16th and a 2021 unprotected First. The 2018 draft had a ton of underrated guys (especially picks 10-12), but also later too. We had Roco at the time so bridges wasn’t going to be a starter so moving him wasn’t the problem, it was the selection of Zaire instead of the other guys that made it. But Zaire almost died and his career get wrecked by an allergy. We never got to see him healthy. Additionally, looking at Bridges numbers the first two years of his career, I’m not sure he would have even survived the trade deadline that first season or if we would have moved him anyway."
u1xdap,Opinion: The 76ers trading Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith should be remembered as an all time bad draft move.,People forget that we had the worst Front Office put in by Adam Silver. Needs to be a 30 for 30 on how to squander 7 years+ of asset acquisitions in two off-seasons and then the brain trust behind it gets fired for having large collars and trying to trade Embiid and build around Simmons.

-make one draft for nba and gleague combined

-give the draft 3 or 4 rounds

-Utilize the gleague to develop those players that need development, such as the players who skip college

wctrmv,[TheBillRussell] An announcement…,"Another basketball legend gone, I remember some weird stat that most of the leagues MVPs are still alive. A relatively young sport is now starting to see the transitions that come with time."
wctrmv,[TheBillRussell] An announcement…,"There really isn't anything that he could have done that he didn't do. 11x champion, 5x MVP, first black coach in the NBA (and AFAIK in the major American pro sports period), civil rights icon, and about 100 other accomplishments. He did everything, and was also the [coolest motherfucker out there.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP7VFiL9tv0) The photo of [him, Jim Brown, Ali, and Kareem](https://andscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gettyimages-78149582-1.jpg?w=700) is such an iconic shot."
wctrmv,[TheBillRussell] An announcement…,"RIP to a legend... some of his unbelievable achievements to be remembered:

**12** NBA Finals Appearances

**11** Championship Rings

**8** Straight Titles

**22.5** Avg Rebounds Per Game

**51** Rebounds In a Single Game"
wctrmv,[TheBillRussell] An announcement…,"Sad.

He didn’t look well during the NBA finals video message."
wctrmv,[TheBillRussell] An announcement…,">It is with a very heavy heart we would like to pass along to all of Bill's friends, fans, & followers:  
>  
>Bill Russell, the most prolific winner in American sports history, passed away peacefully today at age 88, with his wife, Jeannine, by his side. Arrangements for his memorial service will be announced soon.  
>  
>Bill's two state championships in high school offered a glimmer of the incomparable run of pure team accomplishment to come: twice an NCAA champion; captain of a gold-medal-winning US Olympic team; 11 times an NBA champion; and at the helm for two NBA championships as the first black head coach of any North American professional sports team.  
>  
>Along the way, Bill earned a string of individual awards that stands unprecedented as it went unmentioned by him. In 2009 the award for the NBA Finals most valuable player was renamed after two-time Hall of Famer as the ""Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award""...  
>  
>...But for all the winning, Bill's understanding of the struggle is what illuminated his life. From boycotting a 1961 exhibition game to unmask too-long-tolerated discrimination, to leading Mississippi's first integrated basketball camp in the combustible wake of Medgar Evans' [sic] assassination, to decades of activism ultimately recognized by his receipt of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2010, Bill called out injustice with an unforgiving candor that he intended would disrupt the status quo, and with a powerful example that, though never his humble intention, will forever inspire teamwork, selflessness, and thoughtful change.   
>  
>Bill's wife, Jeannine, and his many friends and family thank you for keeping Bill in your prayers. Perhaps you'll relive one or two of the golden moments he gave us, or recall his trademark laugh as he delighted in explaining the real story behind how those moments unfolded. And we hope each of us can find a new way to act of speak with Bill's uncompromising, dignified, and always constructive commitment to principle. That would be one last, and lasting, win for our beloved #6."
wctrmv,[TheBillRussell] An announcement…,I’m reminded of that one clip where he tells Kobe he couldn’t be prouder than if he was his own son. Now they are both gone. RIP
wctrmv,[TheBillRussell] An announcement…,RIP to #6. Loved Bill and his stories he’d tell while chatting with players. His interview with KG is an all time fave. He will be sorely missed.
wctrmv,[TheBillRussell] An announcement…,What a legendary life he lived. Maybe we can take a short break from crapping on that generation.
wctrmv,[TheBillRussell] An announcement…,RIP to the greatest winner who ever lived
wctrmv,[TheBillRussell] An announcement…,"Feels weird even though he’s 88. Man paved the way for a lot of coaches/players and his off the court ventures are just legendary stuff from people who just think of him as a hooper. 

Godspeed and rip for real"

v7cx29,"[Bob Myers] on critics of Warriors’ league-leading payroll: “You should be allowed to spend on your own players. We drafted these guys, we developed them. It’s not like we went out and signed all these guys as free agents.”",The main issue with Warriors paying their players is that they're winning which justifies the spending.  Most other sports owners across all leagues really don't like that.
v7cx29,"[Bob Myers] on critics of Warriors’ league-leading payroll: “You should be allowed to spend on your own players. We drafted these guys, we developed them. It’s not like we went out and signed all these guys as free agents.”","If anything, I still believe that contracts for home-grown players should have a discounted hit against the tax, with the discount increasing over the years.

Not to help the Warriors obviously (though it would), but to help smaller markets retain their players and build around them without excessive luxury tax penalties. Reward players staying and make it easier for teams to enable that."

v7cx29,"[Bob Myers] on critics of Warriors’ league-leading payroll: “You should be allowed to spend on your own players. We drafted these guys, we developed them. It’s not like we went out and signed all these guys as free agents.”","I’m obviously jealous that they can pay maxes to Klay and Wiggins, a super max to Steph, and possible have Draymond and Poole for 25 mil each a year. But that’s just good team building.

Meanwhile the Bucks have 3 max contracts and just like that all we can give out now is minimums and MDEs"
v7cx29,"[Bob Myers] on critics of Warriors’ league-leading payroll: “You should be allowed to spend on your own players. We drafted these guys, we developed them. It’s not like we went out and signed all these guys as free agents.”",Our team before this owner was notorious for letting talent go after/during their first contract.
v7cx29,"[Bob Myers] on critics of Warriors’ league-leading payroll: “You should be allowed to spend on your own players. We drafted these guys, we developed them. It’s not like we went out and signed all these guys as free agents.”","I mean the cap is working as intended. You can go over the cap to pay your own players, but you can't go over the cap to get high priced free agents.

Getting KD was a fluke. Steph was in the last year of a cheap contract, and the TV revenue had just skyrocketed causing a dramatic increase in the cap, giving them enough cap room to sign KD before re-signing Steph to a max."
v7cx29,"[Bob Myers] on critics of Warriors’ league-leading payroll: “You should be allowed to spend on your own players. We drafted these guys, we developed them. It’s not like we went out and signed all these guys as free agents.”","They literally did exactly what every front office is supposed to do, even the KD teams lol.

Draft and develop amazing players, use them to attract a superstar? Like, yeah? That's what everyone is tryna do."
v7cx29,"[Bob Myers] on critics of Warriors’ league-leading payroll: “You should be allowed to spend on your own players. We drafted these guys, we developed them. It’s not like we went out and signed all these guys as free agents.”","I don't get how it's unfair.  They are paying the luxury tax for spending too much.  They make so much they can afford it from being such a top flight franchise. 

How many owners would be willing to do that?  Not many"
v7cx29,"[Bob Myers] on critics of Warriors’ league-leading payroll: “You should be allowed to spend on your own players. We drafted these guys, we developed them. It’s not like we went out and signed all these guys as free agents.”","It’s funny how this is now a talking point after they make the finals. Like they weren’t paying these guys max contracts the past 2 years and paying the luxury tax while not making the playoffs. Like any business, you make the investment upfront for the payoff on the back end.

No one was complaining about them paying the luxury tax when they couldnt win 20 games a year"
v7cx29,"[Bob Myers] on critics of Warriors’ league-leading payroll: “You should be allowed to spend on your own players. We drafted these guys, we developed them.

>And that's what makes this whole Michael Jordan triple-double thing silly.

>Simply, he is above it all, no matter what he thinks.

>Since moving to point guard 16 games ago, Jordan has recorded eight triple-doubles, including a streak of seven in a row that was snapped Friday night against Detroit. He has 11 for the season.

>Since Jordan's move from off-guard, the Bulls have gone 11-5. That, in itself, should be reward enough.

>But even Jordan has been caught in triple-double-mania.

>During breaks in games, Jordan has been wandering over to the scorer's table to get updates on how many rebounds, assists and points he needs to fill his three double-figure quotas.

>""The guys at the scorer's desk let me know what I need,"" he said. ""They tell me, 'You need three assists; you need two rebounds.""'

>Jordan also has been double-checking the figures with Chicago assistants.

>""They keep me in tune,"" he said. ""They keep reminding me when I come back to the huddle, how much I need.""

>Last Sunday, at home against New Jersey, the 10th assist was Jordan's final goal.

>""I knew I had nine assists,"" he said, ""and I looked at (forward) Brad (Sellers), and said, 'Brad, can I count on you for my 10th?' And he said, 'yeah' and hit a jumper from the baseline."""

However, these awards, all of them, have strongly relied on media narratives and the popularity of players at the current time. It's kind of like Luka Modric winning the Ballon D'or in 2018. No one really believes he was the best player in the world that year, he was awarded because of Croatia's run to the World Cup final.

And you know what? Subjective criteria is fine by me.

But in particular the MIP choices this year seem absurd."
v97yrb,"Danny Ainge was criticized for wasting resources, but since 2014 every draft's first round has yielded a player or asset directly helping Boston on their current run",Robert Williams landing at 27th was both luck and a blessing.
v97yrb,"Danny Ainge was criticized for wasting resources, but since 2014 every draft's first round has yielded a player or asset directly helping Boston on their current run","It's hard to judge Danny without mentioning the injury to Gordon Hayward. That team was stacked, and his career hasn't been the same since."
v97yrb,"Danny Ainge was criticized for wasting resources, but since 2014 every draft's first round has yielded a player or asset directly helping Boston on their current run","Hayward breaking his ankle was the downfall of Ainge's plans, I think. That was so unfortunate and really hurt the Celtics."
v97yrb,"Danny Ainge was criticized for wasting resources, but since 2014 every draft's first round has yielded a player or asset directly helping Boston on their current run",He was more criticized for not using some of those picks to make trades for established players.
v97yrb,"Danny Ainge was criticized for wasting resources, but since 2014 every draft's first round has yielded a player or asset directly helping Boston on their current run",Ainge also *created* a ton of resources. The Garnett/Pierce trade was the steal of the century. Trading back from 1 to 3 in 2017 was a god-tier move which also allowed us all to dunk on Philly for a few years.
v97yrb,"Danny Ainge was criticized for wasting resources, but since 2014 every draft's first round has yielded a player or asset directly helping Boston on their current run",Always felt like he was incredible at his job. The value he got back from Pierce and KG to the nets might be one of the best trades ever.
v97yrb,"Danny Ainge was criticized for wasting resources, but since 2014 every draft's first round has yielded a player or asset directly helping Boston on their current run",Just want to remind people that Tatum was really not a consensus pick. Old enough to remember many people wanted us to draft Josh Jackson. Danny Ainge deserves a statue in Boston for these drafts alone.
v97yrb,"Danny Ainge was criticized for wasting resources, but since 2014 every draft's first round has yielded a player or asset directly helping Boston on their current run","I imagine being a good GM is a lot like being good at poker. You’ve got to gamble a bit. Commit to some hands, pass on others. There is a little bit of luck involved. Over time skill the skilled players will shine."
v97yrb,"Danny Ainge was criticized for wasting resources, but since 2014 every draft's first round has yielded a player or asset directly helping Boston on their current run",What's crazy is Ainge almost threw this all away with the trade offer of 4 1sts for the right to draft Winslow.  Crazy that Charlotte/Jordan did not take that deal and instead drafted Kaminsky.
v97yrb,"Danny Ainge was criticized for wasting resources, but since 2014 every draft's first round has yielded a player or asset directly helping Boston on their current run","That's impressive.

Don’t say anything here you wouldn’t say to my face.”,"Skip called Terrell Owens a team obliterator when he was sitting two feet away from him on Undisputed. And he said Dwight Howard looks like Tarzan but plays like Jane to his face on First Take and he called Chris Bosh “bosh spice” to his face as well. 

All in all, I’m 99% sure that Skip would call him “Westbrick” to his face. But I’m not sure if Russ would be crazy enough on that day to punch him in the jaw right afterwards."

Both the 6ers and Harden look genius from that trade."
yjyxzz,James Harden leaving Brooklyn before the situation there got so much worse is even funnier now,Harden was the most levelheaded and leaderlike of the Netzis Big 3. Only fitting he would be the first to bail on that shitshow since he is like the only normal person there.
yjyxzz,James Harden leaving Brooklyn before the situation there got so much worse is even funnier now,Harden felt disrespected that Kyrie didn't recognize his WW2 accomplishments.
yjyxzz,James Harden leaving Brooklyn before the situation there got so much worse is even funnier now,Respect to Harden now. He's the real baller and even took a pay cut to get the right players needed for a championship run.
yjyxzz,James Harden leaving Brooklyn before the situation there got so much worse is even funnier now,I love seeing the Nets fans that hated on Harden for being a quitter eat shit
yjyxzz,James Harden leaving Brooklyn before the situation there got so much worse is even funnier now,"Yea…I was one of those critics, but clearly he was right.  I would’ve done whatever to escape that dumpsterfire of a locker room.  Harden was probably so excited to team with his boys only to realize they’re ridiculously toxic.

What a waste of what could’ve been a dominant big 3."
yjyxzz,James Harden leaving Brooklyn before the situation there got so much worse is even funnier now,"Two seasons ago Harden was one of the most controversial, if not outright disliked, players on this sub due to how some people thought he ended his time with Houston, his foul-hunting ways, and how it seemed he didn't take training and his body as serious as he should (especially with his public partying). Fast forward to today and he's the only one of the big names involved in the Brooklyn drama that came out looking better, videos of him putting in work over the summer were posted regularly, and he took less money to help his team. I tend to hate all things Philly, but from a public perception standpoint that's got to be one one of the biggest, and quickest, NBA turnarounds in some time."
yjyxzz,James Harden leaving Brooklyn before the situation there got so much worse is even funnier now,"posted this elsewhere but:

>He told the Rockets he wanted out months in advance, they lied and said they’d explore trades when in actuality they intended to force him to compete with a team that wasn’t competitive. Harden voiced that multiple times behind closed doors before that famous “it can’t be fixed” press conference.

>On the Nets, Harden was fully bought in. Initially he and KD were making it work without Kovidrie, then KD got injured, and the organization showed no backbone and instead walked back their earlier stance of “team players, no part time”. And Harden was expected to do all the heavy lifting while occasionally having to play with an obviously mentally inept Kyrie Irving on road games.

>To me, Harden didn’t quit on either of those teams. The Rockets faked amicability while outright lying to his face, and the  Nets betrayed his trust while expecting him to babysit an 11 year old who thinks he knows the answers to all the universes’ questions."
yjyxzz,James Harden leaving Brooklyn before the situation there got so much worse is even funnier now,"It don't take a genius to leave a situation where one idiot refuses to play because he won't get a vaccine during a fucking pandemic. While his other teammate defends that looney, and enables such behaviour. 

But yeah... Harden was smart to see the signs & move to a better & more stable environment where he has a really good chance of winning it all as well."

115u4sq,Reporter: “What city needs an NBA Team?” KD: “Seattle”,reporter with one of the easiest assists imaginable
115u4sq,Reporter: “What city needs an NBA Team?” KD: “Seattle”,"Its still strange to me that he played a year as a Supersonic lol.  That feels like a lifetime ago.

v2i4zn,Stephen A. Smith: I believe Steph Curry will eclipse Lebron James and capture 5 championships in his career while Lebron is still stuck on 4,The discourse after whoever wins these finals is going to be crazy
v2i4zn,Stephen A. Smith: I believe Steph Curry will eclipse Lebron James and capture 5 championships in his career while Lebron is still stuck on 4,These guys love turning everything into 1 vs 1. Extra points for including LeBron ofc.
v2i4zn,Stephen A. Smith: I believe Steph Curry will eclipse Lebron James and capture 5 championships in his career while Lebron is still stuck on 4,He doesn’t even have 4 yet and Stephen A. is giving him 5 lol 😂

All he said is 5 > 4. Simple maffs"
v2i4zn,Stephen A. Smith: I believe Steph Curry will eclipse Lebron James and capture 5 championships in his career while Lebron is still stuck on 4,"‘If Steph gets more rings than LeBron, he’ll have more rings than LeBron which means he’s better.’ This is ESPN analysis"
v2i4zn,Stephen A. Smith: I believe Steph Curry will eclipse Lebron James and capture 5 championships in his career while Lebron is still stuck on 4,Maybe he will win more championships. But he’ll never surpass Lebron as a player. No one is going to forget Lebron being obviously the better player for damn near a decade straight.
v2i4zn,Stephen A. Smith: I believe Steph Curry will eclipse Lebron James and capture 5 championships in his career while Lebron is still stuck on 4,"Seen one guy put it best. If Steph does win 5 rings, this is the difference between the 2 in favor of Lebron:

- 2 MVPs

- 2 FMVPs (assuming Steph wins the next 2)

- 10 All-Stars

- 9 All-NBA 1st Teams

- 5 All-Defense 1st Teams

- ROY

- Assists Leader

That’s a whole ass HOF career, and it’s only scratching the surface. Steph will never eclipse Lebron so don’t bother debating about it and just enjoy them play."
v2i4zn,Stephen A. Smith: I believe Steph Curry will eclipse Lebron James and capture 5 championships in his career while Lebron is still stuck on 4,Stephen A Smith and ESPN/Fox sports have and have always had an agenda against players in the league these days. They prop up guys with good accomplishments to and then use those things to tear down the others at will to keep regurgitating content.

Very few people talk about the fact that Joel Embiid had 16 turnovers in the final 2 games of that series,"Ben for sure caught the lions share of the blame because of how egregious that moment was. Thybulle missed the free throws, embiid disappeared in like 3 straight 4th quarters to close the series and Tobias disappeared entirely from game 4 4th quarter on. That said Ben was also pathetic offensively the entire series, as he's been in every 2nd round he's ever played in. That moment gets the focus but it was really just the straw that broke the camels back with his poor playoff performances"

Very few people talk about the fact that Joel Embiid had 16 turnovers in the final 2 games of that series,"This is hogwash lol. Look at their stats for that series. The infamous Simmons play was a microcosm of a larger issue.  He failed to exceed 8 points in three straight games, averaging 4.5 FGAs per game in that span. It was an utter disaster. Sometimes great players try and fail. In the case of Ben Simmons, he quit altogether."
wh1x4g,Everyone talks about Ben Simmons passing up a dunk in the 2021 playoffs vs the Hawks. Very few people talk about the fact that Joel Embiid had 16 turnovers in the final 2 games of that series,"From the opposing teams perspective, it looked to me like Embiid just ran out of psychical and mental energy to overcome what his team lacked. Us being able to basically ignore Ben Simmons made Embiid twice as easy to defend and he had no counter. He eventually just stopped really attacking the basket cause we swarmed every time he put it on the floor. Felt bad for the guy tbr. He was dominating us."

The fact that Embiid actually tries to be the best he can be is why his shortcomings are forgiven by the fanbase"
wh1x4g,Everyone talks about Ben Simmons passing up a dunk in the 2021 playoffs vs the Hawks.

wh1x4g,Everyone talks about Ben Simmons passing up a dunk in the 2021 playoffs vs the Hawks. Very few people talk about the fact that Joel Embiid had 16 turnovers in the final 2 games of that series,"Embiid's playmaking is a weakness, especially when he's doubled, it's a weakness in his game, a 6'10 uber athletic guy being afraid to go up and dunk over a 6'0 dude isn't a weakness, it's being afraid. Having weaknesses is okay, being a afraid isn't.

Btw part (not all) of Embiid's playmaking problem could (and still can to some extent) be attributed to the Sixers' spacing, and yeah having your ""point guard"" in the dunker's spot on every play makes doubling Joel a whole lot easier"

For example, some oldhead will say the GOAT PG is Bob Cousy and some nephew will say it's Chris Paul (this is just an example). The oldhead will hold CP3's lack of rings against him and the nephew will say Bob shot 39% against plumbers and milkmen. The disappointing thing about GOAT debates is that either side will magnify the struggle that THEIR GOAT went through and downplay the struggle that the opposite side went through. ""Uhhh Bob had to ride covered wagons on the Oregon Trail,"" ""uhhh CP3 had to endure countless injuries to play at the highest talent level to date,"" etc. It's not about wanting to find out who's theoretically better between the two anymore, it's about who can fanboy harder."

If you slap someone and then yank their shirt to the ground to stop follow through you probably gonna have to fight shortly after.

10ni0nv,[Analysis] There is a 0.000003% chance that the discrepancy between Jaren Jackson Jr.'s Blocks/Steals is solely due to random distribution,Someone explain to me why there’s a picture of the Indian army ?
10ni0nv,[Analysis] There is a 0.000003% chance that the discrepancy between Jaren Jackson Jr.'s Blocks/Steals is solely due to random distribution,"Interesting analysis, but I don't think a Z-test is necessarily the best test to compare these datasets. To my understanding, a Z-Test assumes that you know the population standard deviation and that you have a sample size above n=30. Source: https://vitalflux.com/when-to-use-z-test-vs-t-test-differences-examples/#:~:text=If%20the%20population%20standard%20deviation,%2C%20T%2Dtest%20is%20recommended.

Per the source above, I think a more appropriate test to conduct would be a two-tailed T-test. This is because we are comparing two small sample sets against one another, whereby we do not know the population mean or standard deviation for either set. Link to a copied spreadsheet using a T-test instead: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gAonkgsy7OBfC2fR7E6jMhxErUHhUqSGLzeKba3zex8/edit?usp=sharing

Note that the outcome remains similar. The T-test has a P-value of 0.0019, suggesting that we reject the null hypothesis (that both sample sets have the same mean). But I think this P-value is a bit less sensationalized than the 0.000003% figure that you generated with the Z-test. 

I am not a statistician, so I can only comment on the relevant statistical hypothesis test to conduct given my limited experience. The value/relevance of the information I'll leave to someone more capable.

I'll also add a thank you for including your analysis! That is what allows multiple people to review each others' work and come up with thoughtful critiques."

uav7sp,"Since forcing his way off a championship level Cavs team, Kyrie has basically ended up in the best possible situations and the results are abysmal",He is incredibly skilled but unfortunately isn’t a good team player and his frequent injuries and weird absences cause too much tension. I wouldn’t want him on my team.
uav7sp,"Since forcing his way off a championship level Cavs team, Kyrie has basically ended up in the best possible situations and the results are abysmal",Playmaking is a wildly underrated skill and the nets not having a playmaker shows
uav7sp,"Since forcing his way off a championship level Cavs team, Kyrie has basically ended up in the best possible situations and the results are abysmal","The problem with Kyrie is between his ears. His antics are the antithesis to the mindset of a championship team. He won with the Cavs since Lebron was leading the way.

He proved in Boston that he doesn’t have what it takes to be a leader, and the way he torpedoed the Nets this year is amazing. He’s quit in multiple playoff series now for multiple teams.

I was excited when the Celtics traded for him (despite losing IT) because I thought he would prove to be something better than he’s shown. 3 years later I can easily say that I’m so happy he decided to leave and take his poison with him."
uav7sp,"Since forcing his way off a championship level Cavs team, Kyrie has basically ended up in the best possible situations and the results are abysmal","Kyrie and KD are in this weird spot where they think that because they both won championships, they are beyond reproach and that their style of play works and can lead to more success. They completely discount the fact that they won because of other factors (Kyrie having Bron and KD having the Warriors).

As others have pointed out, the other problem is that Kyrie is truly a fucking dumbass and does not know how to lead in any capacity."
uav7sp,"Since forcing his way off a championship level Cavs team, Kyrie has basically ended up in the best possible situations and the results are abysmal","The things Kyrie needs most to succeed, structure and good leadership, are also the things he hates the most. He actively tries to avoid or push away these things."
uav7sp,"Since forcing his way off a championship level Cavs team, Kyrie has basically ended up in the best possible situations and the results are abysmal",He’a really not a proven winner pre and post LeBron
uav7sp,"Since forcing his way off a championship level Cavs team, Kyrie has basically ended up in the best possible situations and the results are abysmal","Even if Kyrie was 100% locked in every game, he still would struggle to win championships because of his iso playstyle and defensive deficiencies. Add to that a propensity to sit out games while healthy plus a lack of respect for coaches/teammates and it’s really not that surprising.

Anyways enjoy that extension Brooklyn."
uav7sp,"Since forcing his way off a championship level Cavs team, Kyrie has basically ended up in the best possible situations and the results are abysmal",KD has once again found himself on a team that should have traded their impulsive point guard instead of James Harden
uav7sp,"Since forcing his way off a championship level Cavs team, Kyrie has basically ended up in the best possible situations and the results are abysmal",LeBron makes people around him look better than they are.
uav7sp,"Since forcing his way off a championship level Cavs team, Kyrie has basically ended up in the best possible situations and the results are abysmal","What's sad is the fact that he hit a huge 3pt shot to help the Cavs win the NBA Finals and from that alone is considered ""clutch/a closer"" when there are ample examples where he showed up small...as seen here. Lebron, however, has hit more game winners in the playoffs and still cannot shake off this ""not clutch"" stigma. Likewise, Steph, has had more memorable moments than Kyrie in the playoffs where he singlehandedly won a game or two off his 10-15 pts scoring spurts but the fact that he has yet to win FMVP, the stigma and myth is ""he doesn't show up in the Finals/playoffs"". It's funny how one moment can change people's overall perception of them."

I reported on this massive crisis over a two-year period","> In the years that followed, Pandya says, more kids that age began to come in, and the operating rooms filled with surgical trainees who came to watch because they had never seen such injuries to kids. But, in time, it became so commonplace that soon the shock wore off -- no longer did an ACL surgery to an 8-year-old raise eyebrows, nor did the constant stream of patients so young seem unusual. Five years ago, Pandya estimates that he alone would see about 1,500 pediatric sports injuries and perform maybe 150 surgeries -- ACL, cartilage, shoulder injuries -- in a single year; those numbers have ""skyrocketed,"" he says, and last year stood at 6,000 and 400, respectively. More than half of his operations are now on those under the age of 14.

Damn

> Pandya sees the kids throughout their rehabilitation process. Some he's seen for years; he reconstructed their ACL only for it to be torn again. In some cases, he has repaired their ACLs three times by their early teenage years. The parents drop the kid off for physical therapy almost every day, but the kid lives with the injury, the rehab, every single day. Sometimes, they'll confide in Pandya.

> *Look, I don't want to go back, the kids will tell him. I'm afraid of going back. I don't enjoy it anymore. I've spent my past three years just rehabbing. That's all I do. I go from one surgery to the next. I just want to be a kid.*

Maybe if he puts it all together he’s a Jamaal Murray type in an upside case, but there’s a lot of failed players of that type in a downside case? Sound right?"

wbwm8f,"Kevin Durant’s trade request has NBA owners looking for changes, even if it takes a lockout to get them","There seemed to be a pretty nice middle ground and then Ben Simmons, KD and Kyrie ruined it for everyone."
wbwm8f,"Kevin Durant’s trade request has NBA owners looking for changes, even if it takes a lockout to get them",The one good idea I’ve heard about player empowerment is a mutual no trade/can’t trade clause for the first two years of any max deal. Would prevent a Blake Griffin situation (player gets max deal then gets shipped out 6 mos later) and would give unhappy players and teams time to work out their issues before requesting a trade. Admittedly you could see more Jimmy Butler/Boogie Cousins trades where teams trade guys before they get another max deal but those guys at least were soon approaching FA.
wbwm8f,"Kevin Durant’s trade request has NBA owners looking for changes, even if it takes a lockout to get them",The Nets have 3 guys that broke the current CBA in terms of commitment expectations. Classic
wbwm8f,"Kevin Durant’s trade request has NBA owners looking for changes, even if it takes a lockout to get them","This was always going to reach a boiling point — owners are not going to want to continue investing hundreds of millions of dollars, and the future of billion-plus dollar properties, in players who think they can leave at any time they want despite their contract. 

The best hope is that the league is just too flush right now such that they’ll just put up with it anyway."
wbwm8f,"Kevin Durant’s trade request has NBA owners looking for changes, even if it takes a lockout to get them",Just keep kd in Brooklyn they got no reason to trade him. I don’t care for owners but this type of situation is dumb af for the league. If he signed a contract and can just leave after a year take the money away sounds fair to me.
wbwm8f,"Kevin Durant’s trade request has NBA owners looking for changes, even if it takes a lockout to get them","Why wouldn’t they? Between Ben Simmons and KD , it just shows these guys (who are getting paid INSANE MONEY) aren’t even attempting to honor the agreement.  Who would do business this way?  It makes the league look really bad too.  This is the definition of chaos. 

To reference Seinfeld, ANYONE can just sign a contract ….but you have to be able to HOLD the contract. 

For the life of me, I cannot understand this level of entitlement."
wbwm8f,"Kevin Durant’s trade request has NBA owners looking for changes, even if it takes a lockout to get them", Imagine there is a lockout and then the Saudis or Chinese start locking guys up for $50-100 million a season in a new league?
wbwm8f,"Kevin Durant’s trade request has NBA owners looking for changes, even if it takes a lockout to get them",Can we start deleting posts that link to pay-walled articles?
wbwm8f,"Kevin Durant’s trade request has NBA owners looking for changes, even if it takes a lockout to get them","What do the owners want changed?

If they want to be able to withhold pay from players who refuse to play, that's not applicable to Durant. And they appear to already have that option, given that the Sixers didn't pay Simmons.

If they want the ability to terminate contracts for players who request trades, the Nets would never terminate Durant's contract. He's hugely valuable as a trade asset. The same was true for Simmons, though to a lesser degree.

There's also no way for the CBA to address trade requests because formal trade requests are extremely rare. Players get fined if they (or their agent) publicly state that they want to be traded (like Anthony Davis), but media reports from anonymous sources aren't formal trade requests."

The worst rated NFL wild card game had 2x the viewers of the NBA finals game 1.

NBA ratings should be compared to the MLB, not the NFL.

ubdlhf,Stop making excuses for the Suns. The Pelicans are without Zion.,"Suns are a 65 win team, it shouldn't be close lol"
ubdlhf,Stop making excuses for the Suns. The Pelicans are without Zion.,"No excuses. The Suns played great even when players were out with injuries all season. I'm curious where the bench disappeared to in the playoffs thus far.

I'll channel my Paul Westphal here:

*We're going to win one at home, go to New Orleans and win one there, and everyone will say what a great series it was.*"
ubdlhf,Stop making excuses for the Suns. The Pelicans are without Zion.,"I’m not sure how much it’s being talked about, but the pelicans have a great coach. He truly inspires his players, especially his star scorer and his young guys. Just the little things he focuses on make a huge impact. 

Confidence goes a long way in sports, and lets not act like the pelicans don’t have talent, they know they’re capable if they give it their all. They’re also playing very well as a team, everyone is pitching in. 

Also, in basketball, matchups make a big difference. Look at the Mavericks/Jazz series. I felt that the mavs without Luka caused more problems for the Jazz just due to the dynamic. 

Lets just enjoy the fact that we have some good first round series, doesn’t matter if it’s your team in the series or not, there is great basketball to be watched!"
ubdlhf,Stop making excuses for the Suns. The Pelicans are without Zion.,Remember when people were clowning AD for saying LA would’ve won had he not been injured? Better keep the same energy.
ubdlhf,Stop making excuses for the Suns. The Pelicans are without Zion.,"Straight up. Suns have no excuses. They are a number one overall team this season with freaking 64 wins who is facing a team with 46 losses. A team that pre-playin, would have been a 9 seed. 

Don’t care what the hell is going on. Suns have to finish this series out. They have the talent for it."

Only among nba fans is it so normal to be a “fan” of a certain team only while their favorite star player is there. Like you’ll see a “nets fan” on this sub referring to the team as “we” and then a month later he’s shitting on the nets while referring to the sixers as “we”. 

Shit like this would get laughed at by fans of almost every other sport. There isn’t as much passion, identity, emotional investment tied to teams as in other sports. 


It’s why you get dumb as shit takes like “teams can trade players but players can’t dictate when they are traded and where they are traded to!?!?!?”."

- Chuck up 30 ft 3s


- When taking mid ranges take faders only and yell “Kobe” or “Luka Special”


- When driving, bearhug the defender into making contact with you



- If a teammate calls for a screen be sure its a moving screen and elbow one of the defenders if they try to go thru it



- On defense embellish contact for offensive fouls like Smart



- Sneak Attack from corner"

But this is a pro pickup move. 5-7 years ago I played in a mens league with a dude who was in his 50s, lost a step or four, but had a knockdown set shot and quick hands. He would get one of these steals a game."

I’m looking at [Spurs executive] R.C. [Buford], you started this all.”","It's a conundrum. If the season is so long that healthy players literally cannot make it through the season without skipping scheduled games at the last second, then that's a problem. 

But on the other hand, it seems like in-game minutes are managed better than they were in previous eras (top 10 MPG in the 90's were generally all 40 or higher, whereas no one hit 38 this year) and playing all games so long as you're healthy has been viable for pretty much the entire history of the league before this era (of course, there's other contributing factors to account for but for the sake of brevity I'll leave those be for now).

Either way, paying for a basketball game these days is a *big* ask for a lot of people. I'm not poor, but I'm certainly not rich, and sitting in the upper deck for a random regular season Pistons game is usually a $100+ excursion once I account for tickets, parking, modest refreshments, gas, etc. I can't make that call to go see a game very often. 

So if I circle a date on a calendar to make it my one game of the year (let's say Cade vs. LeBron), only to find out on gameday that both Cade and LeBron have decided to make themselves healthy scratches... I can't vibe with that as a consumer of product. 

If the NBA wants to institute a refund or future discount policy for these moments, then you're probably making headway (if LBJ sits after you've bought a ticket, you get a free ticket to a future game). Otherwise, I find it to be a problematic business model. It's like buying tickets to see Top Gun: Maverick but the theater decides to edit out Tom Cruise once you're in your seats."

It's funny because a lot of people on here think Steph in 2016 is peak Steph but as I've been saying THIS is peak Steph. Physically he's just a different player now.

He was dining with a well-known lawyer and their wives.  I eavesdropped.

The lawyer was clearly a basketball fan.  He repeatedly asked Lacob about a couple Warriors.  Lacob's answer was exactly the same every time:  'he is a dedicated athlete in peak physical condition.'  It was a humorous way to tell the guy to stop prying for inside information."

v5ssgd,[Post Game Thread] The Golden State Warriors even the series 1-1 in the 107-88 win over the Boston Celtics behind a third quarter barrage.,I think Otto Porter answering the Celtics little mini run was crucial. They hit two back to back threes to cut our 12 point lead to 6 and then our ball movement to Otto in the corner extended it back to 9. I think that was the most important play of the game. Also I like that we went more traditional high pick n roll this game. We need more of that when the motion isn't working! Great defense this game allowed for alot of easy transition buckets.

10e4rl8,"LeBron tonight: 48 PTS, 8 REB, and 9 AST in the W!",It'd be tragic if they don't even make the playoffs when LeBron is still dominating like this
10e4rl8,"LeBron tonight: 48 PTS, 8 REB, and 9 AST in the W!",The Lakers needed old man Bron to drop 48/9/8 in 36 mins to win against one of the bad teams in the league. Welp

10e4rl8,"LeBron tonight: 48 PTS, 8 REB, and 9 AST in the W!","I actually think the Lakers have been missing Austin Reaves the most the past few games (aside from AD of course). That type of glue guy who was providing about 15pts a game in their wins, while making effort plays, and playing smart basketball would've more than made up the difference in their recent close losses."
10e4rl8,"LeBron tonight: 48 PTS, 8 REB, and 9 AST in the W!",The NBA should force the Lakers to trade their picks at this point.
10e4rl8,"LeBron tonight: 48 PTS, 8 REB, and 9 AST in the W!","48 Points on 60/50/90 splits is fucking insane for any player. This man is doing it at 38 years old, when the fuck is he gonna slow down."
10e4rl8,"LeBron tonight: 48 PTS, 8 REB, and 9 AST in the W!",They really needed 48 points from old man James just to beat the Rockets smh

He’s just a competitor trying to win.  All respect, hope to see him in the finals.  This guy taking self-sacrifice to heart and that is not what Brooklyn was about."
w1onnc,[Haynes] James Harden tells Sixers “sign who we [need] to sign and give me whatever is left over” with new deal,"Damn that paragraph about his criticisms is real. He barely had time to adjust with PHI and Embiid had like 32 injuries all at once. Hopefully with more depth, off-season rest, and time to gel they can make a run. I’d love to see Embiid and harden both succeed once"
w1onnc,[Haynes] James Harden tells Sixers “sign who we [need] to sign and give me whatever is left over” with new deal,">”I don’t really listen to what people are saying. I wasn’t right last season and I still almost averaged a triple-double,” Harden told Yahoo Sports. “If anybody else had those numbers, we’d be talking about them getting the max. People were used to seeing me averaging 40, 30 points, and so they viewed it as a down year. I was in Philadelphia for a couple of months and I had to learn on the fly. That’s just what it was. I’m in a good space physically and mentally right now, and I’m just looking forward to next season.”

He is not wrong here, he averaged 22/8/10 on 58% TS despite having a bad season and people are acting like he is Westbrook or something. He is still an amazing player and I really am hopeful that he will bounce back next season to be even better."

And so every time he’d come back from injury, he had to rebuild himself both individually and in terms of his role within the team and he never really found a good rhythm in Dallas.

It’s good to see him healthy and playing well in Washington."

ze9n01,"[Fischer] “Luka is a generational talent. You have to put the perfect team around him to try to get the maximum out of him, you know?” Porzingis said. “I just wasn’t the right guy.”","He started looking like the right guy. He just couldn't be relied to stay on the floor consistently to keep that chemistry with Luka. That bubble run was a glimpse of what could have been with the duo. Unfortunately he got hurt in the playoffs and missed a couple of months to start the season after. I'll still root for him though even if it didn't work out. He was always very professional with his interviews, eventhough there were probably times he could have been frustrated with his end as a Mav. Hoping this is the year he stays healthy."

GGs Sixers. Everyone getting ahead of themselves with the last two games, I just knew that tonight would be rough. Hoped we could pull it out especially at half, but that third quarter was completely brutal.

Absolutely shitty, but honestly despite the loss, I’m happy with the season. We weren’t expected to do much at all, outside of Raps fans expectations, but to have Scottie flourish like he did and win ROTY after so many people (myself included at the time) were skeptical of the pick, FVV getting All-Star, Siakam playing at an All-NBA level, and taking these Sixers to six, I’m overall okay with this season and even more excited for the future."

# DATA 340: NLP Course Project

## Abstract:

This project analyzes the sentiment of named entities gathered from the top 1,000 [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/) posts from the past year. The goal of this project is to identify which players and teams get the most attention and if that focus by the community is in mostly negative or positive ways. This project will give a better understanding of the opinions the NBA community as a whole has on the different aspects of the NBA. The data set I generated contains the top 1,000 posts from the past year starting from 3/11/2022 to 3/11/2023. For each post, there are ten comments saved in a list. With this dataset, I used the [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) package to extract the named entities of each post’s title and comments. In addition, I used the Transformers' sentiment analysis function to identify if a post title and its comments had positive or negative sentiments. This gives a general view of if the named entities in the comments and titles are being talked about in a positive or negative manner in general. With this information, I generated a variety of graphs to visualize the findings for the titles and comments. The main finding of this project is that the majority of titles and comments are negative in sentiment. In addition, the players with the most negative posts are those who had a large amount of drama throughout the given time period. Future work can identify the most frequent words used to describe these players and how related they are.

## Introduction:

In this project, I hope to better understand how fans talk about the NBA including its players and teams. I gathered this data from the subreddit [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/). This subreddit is a place for users to discuss a wide range of topics about the NBA including post-game thoughts, news about players, and more. I have a long list of questions to better understand the discourse around the teams and players. What players do users discuss the most frequently? Are the players who are mentioned the most talked about favorably or unfavorably? Are there players who are talked about disproportionally compared to their impact on the court? What team is talked about the most? Conversely, which teams are talked about the least frequently? This list of questions is long sprawling and likely to expand throughout the project. My desire to answer these questions stems from my love of the NBA as well as the conversations and discourse around it. I know that the broader community and I have certain perspectives on how that discourse is shaped, but I am curious if these assumptions align with the truth. It is possible that others and I only see a fraction of the opinions fans share, There may be a whole other group that has different views of the NBA than we do. I want to uncover these opinions and have a better understanding of the feelings of the NBA community as a whole. Answering these questions will give a better understanding of how the NBA community on Reddit feels and discusses its components. Additionally, this information could spur additional research and provide insight for the NBA as a whole to understand how people view their product. Gathering this information could inform future marketing or operating policies.

## Methodology/Dataset:

To generate the dataset for this project, I used the [Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW)](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/API). The dataset contains 1,000 rows that represent the top 1,000 posts from the past year, starting from 3/11/2022 to 3/11/2023. For each of those 1,000 posts, the top 10 comments are saved as a list. If the post has body text, that is saved as a string. Some posts do not have body text, especially if the original post was sharing a media file such as a tweet or video. All of this information was then saved to a CSV file which can be obtained [here](data/nba_reddit_threads_data.csv). The code used to generate the data set can be found in this [notebook](project_notebooks/data_set_creation.ipynb). Additional information about the data set can be found [here](data_set_creation.md).

For my analysis, I loaded the generated dataset into a Python notebook. I first looked at the 10,000 comments I gathered. To identify the Named Entities, I used the pipeline function from the Transformers library. For each comment, I generated the Named Entities and saved the selected words. This gave me a list of named entities for each of the comments which I could do later analysis. This method was best for my approach because it is a pre-trained model. I do not have labeled data for the named entities and for that reason needed a pre-trained model. For each comment, I additionally passed it through the Sentiment Analysis pipeline from the Transformers library. This gave a label of positive or negative for each comment. I chose this method for a similar reason as choosing the Named Entity Classifier. With this combined information, I could identify how players and teams are talked about. I repeated this process for the titles of each post. Once I had the named entities and the sentiments for both types of text, I moved on to visualizing my findings.

For graphing the findings, I used Plotnine which is based on ggplot2. This gave me fine-grained control over every aspect of the graphs. The main visualizations I made were bar graphs that identified the highest frequency counts of named entities, the percentage of positive and negative comments/titles, the entities with the largest amount of negative sentiments, the entities with the highest percentage of negative sentiments, the entities with the largest amount of positive sentiments, and the entities with the highest percentage of positive sentiments. These visualizations gave a good understanding of the recurring entities with generally negative or positive views from the community.

## Results:

The results of the methodology are best shown in each of the graphs below. They are broken into major categories: the entities from the post comments and the entities from the post titles. Within each of these groups, I looked at the top 25 entities based on their frequency, the proportion of negative and positive sentiments, the count of negative and positive sentiments for each entity, and the percentage of negative and positive sentiments for each entity. I did not look at the entity counts for the titles since it was a smaller sample size and matched the results of the percentages.

There are some major findings that are important to highlight. Both the titles and comments had more text with negative sentiments than positive ones. The players that are talked about the most are those who are considered the best at the moment. The teams that are talked about the most are the larger media markets. Players that have had large amounts of drama in the past year have more negative comments about them when compared to other players. Lastly, players from past generations have a higher percentage of positive comments.

### Top Named Entities For Comments & Titles

This graph shows the top 25 entities from the comments based on their count frequency. Unsurprisingly, the NBA is the most talked about entity. The most popular players based on this metric were Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Luka Dončić, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and LeBron James. The top teams were the Los Angeles Lakers, Golden State Warriors, Boston Celtics, and Brooklyn Nets.

![Top 25 Comment Named Entities](images/top_25_comment_entities.png)

This graph shows the top 25 entities from the titles of each post based on their count frequency. This distribution is roughly similar to the comment distribution. One major difference is Wojnarowski and ESPN being so high. This is because [Adrian Wojnarowski](https://www.espn.com/nba/world-of-woj/) is a reporter from ESPN who is often mentioned as the main source for all breaking news in the titles. He does not appear in the comments as much because they are referring to the contents of the story instead of the reporting.

### Split of Positive & Negative Sentiments for Comments & Titles

Both of these graphs examine the distribution of sentiments. The first graph looks at the comments and the second looks at the titles. The overwhelming takeaway is that r/NBA posts which are the most up-voted have a negative sentiment a majority of the time. The titles are slightly less negative but still a majority are.

### Most Positive & Negative Entities for Comments

#### Negative Comments

This graph looks at the entities that have the highest count of negative comments. The distribution of the counts almost perfectly lines up with the baseline frequency. This is not too surprising since we saw that the majority of comments skew negative and that entities talked about more are therefore more likely to have more negative sentiment counts. To counteract this, I looked at the percentage of negative comments in the next graph.

![Comment Entities With The Most Negative Sentiments](images/comment_negative_count.png)

This graph looks at the entities that have the highest percentage of negative comments. This means of the total amount of times this entity appeared, what percent of the time was the comment negative. By being percentages instead of counts, the distribution is much less skewed and show more entities that do not have very high baseline counts. The main takeaways are that Jordan Poole, Kawhi Leonard, Skip Bayless, Kevin Durant, and Ben Simmons are the players with the highest percentage of negative comments. Skip Bayless stands out because he is a TV personality while the others are all players. As a note, the entity that is blank represents the stories that had no recognizable named entities.

#### Positive Comments

This graph shows the entities with the highest count of positive comments. It is once again similar to the basic count graph. For this reason, the percentage graph is more helpful.

![Comment Entities With The Most Positive Sentiments](images/comment_positive_count.png)

This graph looks at the entities with the highest percentage of positive comments. This means of the total amount of times this entity appeared, what percent of the time was the comment positive. The Dirk Nowitzki, Marcus Smart, Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Jayson Tatum. These results, besides Marcus Smart and Jayson Tatum, could show that players from past generations are talked about with more positivity than current-day players.

### Most Positive & Negative Entities for Titles

#### Negative Titles

This graph looks at entities with the highest percentage of negative titles. The leaders are Kyrie Irving, Draymond Green, Ben Simmons, Jordan Poole, and Ja Morant. Each of these players has had their own off-court drama over the past year.

![Title Entities With The Highest % Of Negative Sentiments](images/title_negative_percentage.png)

#### Positive Titles

This graph looks at the entities with the highest percentage of positive titles. The leaders are Luka Dončić, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokic, and James Harden. These findings are surprising because I would have thought the consensus opinion for both Russel Westbrook and James Harden would be negative.

## Discussion:

### Main Findings & Implications

The results of this project indicate that the majority of titles and comments for posts on r/NBA have a negative sentiment. Because these posts were the most upvoted, this could indicate that the negative discourse garners the most engagement by users. This finding can be consistent with the general assumption of the internet, where negative emotions can garner the most action. 

Another finding is that the players who are talked about the most are the "Super Stars" of the league. This means the players who are considered the best in the league by consensus. As for teams, the bigger market teams dominated the discourse. These markets include Los Angles, New York, Boston, and San Francisco. This finding is important because there is [longstanding debate about whether there is an unfair advantage for bigger market teams in getting players and support](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1865112-does-market-size-even-matter-anymore-in-the-nba). These results indicate that the larger markets get more attention from Reddit users in r/NBA. Further research is needed to understand if this added attention is because of how good the teams are or if it is because of market size.

The graph that shows the entities with the highest percentage of negative comments has a variety of interesting takeaways. The most surprising is that Jordan Poole had the highest percentage of negative comments. Jordan Poole plays for the Golden State Warriors and is usually considered a 6th man. This means he does not start for the team and is not close to a star player like Stephen Curry or LeBron James. Despite this, he gets the highest percentage of negativity. Some possible explanations are his play style, or more likely, an event where [Draymond Green punched Jordan Poole earlier this season](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10051693-warriors-draymond-green-apologizes-for-punching-jordan-poole-i-was-wrong). An additional surprise from this graph is that [Skip Bayless, a TV personality on Fox Sports Undisputed](https://www.foxsports.com/shows/skip-and-shannon-undisputed/about), had the 3rd highest percentage. It is interesting that an individual who is not even part of the actual games or broadcast could dominate the graph. A possible explanation is that Skip Bayless usually has absurd and harsh opinions on players, which could inadvertently increase the negativity surrounding him. 

The results for negative titles are more self-explaining and follow the trends of news stories over the past year. Kyrie Irving, Draymond Green, Ben Simmons, and Jordan Poole lead the results. Kyrie and Ben are understandable because they had a lot of drama while on the Brooklyn Nets. These stories included [Kyrie demanding a trade]((https://www.nba.com/news/kyrie-irving-requests-trade) ) and [Ben Simmons having continual back problems]((https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33857255/brooklyn-nets-ben-simmons-undergo-back-surgery-expected-recovery-line-3-4-months-sources-say)) which kept him from playing. Similarly, Draymond Green and Jordan Poole were also linked in drama as teammates. At the start of the year, [Green punched Poole during a practice](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10051693-warriors-draymond-green-apologizes-for-punching-jordan-poole-i-was-wrong), sparking an outrage in the NBA community. For these reasons, these results are consistent with assumptions. 

For the entities with the highest percentage of comments, 3 of the top 5 were players from the past generations. Those 3 include Dirk Nowitzki, Michael Jordan, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. This positivity towards the past generations can be explained in a couple of ways. For Dirk, it could be because of his well-admired championship run in 2011. Many look upon that championship fondly because he accomplished it without another star player. As for Michael Jordan, it could be because he is considered the greatest player of all time. The most surprising of these 3 is Kareem, who during his playing time was often called aloof and boring (Pearlman). An explanation could be increasing nostalgia for past-generation, or reverence as people appreciate his accomplishments more once LeBron James passed him in all-time scoring.



### Drawbacks & Limitations

There are a few limitations to this study. Firstly, players and teams can be referred to in a variety of ways. Players are often referred to by their first or last name, as well as their signature nicknames. In addition, teams can be referred to by their name or by their city. These different ways of referring to the same entity make it hard to pinpoint how many times they are being talked about. In addition, there are spelling mistakes in a more informal medium like Reddit comments. It is clear in the graphs that LeBron is often misspelled as Lebron. This could be fixed by making the text lowercase, but informal errors extend past solely capitalization. Another potential limitation is that the data is only the most up-voted posts, so it could be overwhelmingly dependent on the news that happened over the year instead of general discourse. 

### Future Work

There is room for expansion on this project. Additional work on identifying the exact adjectives used for each player could give a better representation of how the community is talking about them. In addition, embeddings could be used to see how closely related each player is. Analysis of other subreddits that are dedicated to basketball, like [r/nbadiscussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/) Together, these advancements would further inform our understanding of the discourse surrounding the NBA product.

### Connection to the Literature

I did not find any projects that had the same goal as this one. For this reason, this project fits into the literature as an initial analysis that can be built upon by further research. It provides important insights into which assumptions are upheld and which are not. With this, future projects can provide additional context for these findings.

## Conclusion:


The goal of this project was to identify the teams and players who were discussed the most frequently on the r/NBA subreddit. In addition, the project aimed to identify if these entities were discussed in a positive or negative light. This project identified that the majority of comments on the subreddit have a negative sentiment and that the individuals with the largest amount of negative comments were those who had off-the-court drama. These findings can provide information to the NBA to identify which players should be marketed more and which entities need help to change their general perception by the NBA community. Future research could identify the most common descriptors of each player as well as which players are grouped together most often based on their sentiments. This could further provide insight on the perception of the NBA and its players and teams.
